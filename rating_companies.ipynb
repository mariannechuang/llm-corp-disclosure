After the harvest, BioEnergia is then sending the trees to kilns where they are turned to charcoal (biomass). This forest is factually carbon positive, meaning it acts as a carbon sink. Indeed, our parcels stock CO2 in the cultivated areas, in the trees and with the soil where leaves degrade into humus. In the past, we were not assessing this impact, relying on the simple methodology to consider the full life cycle effect of the charcoal as nil, as the CO2 stocked in the trunk was supposed to be released later at our steel plant. But in 2020-21, we decided to follow the best practices emerging in Brazil and conduct a specific and thorough CO2e impact analysis, with the help of experts. They confirmed our assumption and the powerful CO2e capture operated by the forestry. We double checked the evaluation, thanks to an external audit, which was done locally by the SGS firm, based on ISO 14064 standard.This new methodology highlights massive carbon captures, now consolidated in Scope 1+2 net in absolute value to bring a complete view of our footprint.\n",

Next, an allocation mechanism is applied taking the approach of a contraction of absolute emissions, in line with Science Based Targets recommendations and based on a 41% to 72% reduction in GHG emissions between 2010 and 2050. For the Group, this comes out to an annual reduction in GHG emissions of 2.5% for direct and indirect GHG emissions.In 2019, Arkema set Science-Based Targets (SBTs) aligned with a trajectory well below 2°C for its Scope 1 and 2 emissions and ozone-depleting substances.

      "@ Base and target year: Target is based on financial years: base year 2021 covers the period from April 2020 to March 2021, target year 2022 covers the period from April 2021 to March 2022.@ Intensity figures: Since AT&S sets the target on kilograms CO2e per € gross value added (GVA), the ''Intensity figure in base year (metric tons CO2e per unit of activity)” and the ''Intensity figure in reporting year (metric tons CO2e per unit of activity)” are not reported as metric tons CO2e but as \"kg CO2e per € GVA\".@ Target achievement: Our target is to reduce the relative carbon footprint by -5% year over year. The target is achieved, as the relative KPI improved by 12.6% compared to the previous year. This is because AT&S increased its GVA by 37.3% while increasing total Scope 1+2 emissions only by 19.9%. This change was achieved through more efficient processes and use of resources, especially at the plant Chongqing and its capacity expansion. The increase in absolute emissions is attributable to higher production volumes and a higher share of highly complex printed circuit boards.@ Relative target in general: The intensity key figure is presented as consumption per gross value added (GVA). Gross value added is calculated on the basis of EBIT plus depreciation and wage and salary expenses. The relative key figures thus represent the resource unit employed per value unit generated.Climate protection is an omnipresent focus of the AT&S sustainability strategy. The Paris Climate Agreement sets a clear goal, which must be accomplished in order to secure a worthwhile future for later generations. In the financial year 2021/22, AT&S made a commitment to the Science Based Targets initiative. This ensures that emission reduction targets set by the company in the future will be considered science-based and aligned with the latest findings of climate science. It's planned to commit the SBTs within the fiscal year 2022/23.\n",

      "This intensity target corresponds to the target Int1 reported in the 2019 CDP questionnaire. Our objective is set on CO2 emissions resulting from onsite power consumption (incl. electricity), business travel (airplane, train, AXA vehicle fleet), and paper consumption per person. Emissions from Home/workplace commuting (round trip) without company cars are not included in the Scope 3 emissions concerned by this target, explaining the 71.5% of our emissions in scope (based on 2012 data). To reach this target, specific targets for power consumption, business travel, office paper, and marketing and distribution paper have also been set. AXA's CO2  emissions per FTE related to paper, power, business travel and AXA vehicle fleet per person increased by 9% between 2018 and 2019 and decreased by 32% since 2012 (AXA global 2020 target has thus been achieved ahead of schedule). Emission factors used to calculate CO2  emissions per FTE have been updated in 2019. When recalculated using the same emission factors as for previous years, CO2  emissions per FTE related to paper, power, business travel and AXA vehicle fleet per person are stable between 2018 and 2019 and decreased by 38% between 2012 and 2019. 37% of the Group's CO2 emissions are related to energy consumption, 46% from business travel (air and train), 14% from AXA's vehicle fleet and 4% from paper. In 2015, science-based targets were set with Carbon Trust for scope 1 and 2 emissions using a Sectoral Decarbonization Approach. A study came to the conclusion that AXA's target concerning scope 1 and 2 was broadly in line with a science-based target but to date the SBTI has not been able to provide validation for these targets.However, it is important to note that AXA has recently fixed new 2025 based targets which are currently under review at the SBTi.

No removals from bioenergy.Please note that years provided cover our financial year from 1 March to end of February.Even if the impact of our own energy consumption on our GHG emissions is low due to our asset-light business model, we identified energy consumption as material because of its significant impact on GHG emissions in our value chain through each contributor. Therefore, one way to decarbonise our products & services would be to reduce the Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions of every value chain contributor, such as in product manufacturing. A successful approach to value chain GHG emission reduction requires us to lead the way ourselves. We systematically analysed our energy consumption, including up-to-date market-based data where available. To optimise our energy consumption, we want to 1) use resources as efficiently as possible and 2) transition to procuring as much renewable energy as possible. That will allow us to encourage direct business partners and value chain contributors to decarbonise their energy consumption. As energy efficient and renewable energy generation technology is available at scale, we consider switching to both a technology adaptation problem. Heating and electricity at our premises are the main drivers of our energy consumption. In 2021/2022, our total rented premises increased due to company growth, which caused our absolute electricity and heating energy consumption to increase. We operated one company car.

      "This absolute target refers only to the AFKL flight operations representing 99.7% of the group's emissions in 2021. In addition,the Group has set itself a target of being carbon neutral by 2030 for ground operations.Aviation is responsible for an estimated 2% to 3% of man‑made greenhouse gas emissions. Despite the Covid‑19 public health crisis and if no action is taken, the forecasts for global air traffic growth in the coming years could, however, see this proportion increase.The aviation industry is the first economic sector to have set ambitious long‑term reduction targets and to have adopted a worldwide carbon offsetting system within the framework of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) to guarantee carbon‑neutral growth for global air transportation as of 2020.In 2009, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) thus set ambitious worldwide targets for reducing the CO2 emissionsfrom air transportation:— 1.5% average annual fuel efficiency improvement until 2020;— carbon neutral growth from 2020 onwards;— a 50% reduction in net aviation CO2 emissions in 2050 relative to the 2005 level.While international aviation is not included in the Paris Climate Agreement, the industry's efforts respond to the latter's target of limiting the global temperature increase to below 2°C. In its Energy Technology Perspectives 2017, the International Energy Agency considers that the airline industry's target for 2050 is more ambitious than what would be required for a 2°C scenario and close to a scenario of beyond 2°C  without taking into account the effects of carbon offsetting.AFKL endorses the IATA's targets and has set itself proprietary intermediate targets aimed at reducing its CO2 emissions by 2030 and 2050.The methodology used by the SBTi to calculate the scope 3 emission is not the same as methodology used by AFKL in the URD. SBTi applied 1.2545 factor to scope 1 to determine scope 1 + 3 emissions, while AFKL used 0.6848 kg CO2/kg Fuel  emission factor for scope 3 based on the ICAO life cycle (89 MJ/kg fuel).Thus, the absolute target SBTi does not correspond to our way of reporting.  However, as the reduction in our scope 1 is directly proportional to the reduction in our scope 3, complying with a 12% reduction in our scope 1 emissions leads to a 12% reduction in our scope 3 emissions regardless of the methodology used.Air France and KLM have the target of operating a carbon-neutral ground operations by 2030. This includes scope 1 and scope 2 emissions related to gas, cooled and heated water, diesel, GtL, kerosene for ground bounded engine testing, and electricity used in the ground operations in France and the Netherlands. We have not submitted this target for approval by the Science-Based Targets initiative as it covers only 0.3% of our total CO2 emissions. We do however consider this as a Science-Based Target as the EU member states must be carbon neutral by 2050  to limit global warming well bellow 2°C. By setting the target year for achieving carbon neutrality twenty years earlier, we aim to contribute to reaching the EU targets. Information : \"Scope 2 emissions in reporting year covered by target\" indicator differs from the URD's \"Greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 2 GHG protocol)\" because URD's Scope 2 only includes electricity while we added Heating/Cooling emissions to this result.\n",
      "In 2019, Air France set a tightened target for the year 2030: increasing energy efficiency by 50% compared to 2005 (in gram of CO2/passenger/km including market-based measures).  The base year is set on 2005 in line with industry standards. This target covers the group activities, including those of Martinair and Transavia in the KL-Group. The target covers more than 99% of our operations as the CO2 emissions from ground operations, accounting to less than 1%, are out of scope. For ground operations AF-KL has set itself the target of achieving a CO2 neutral operation by 2030. To monitor progress, the intensity indicator is monitored as main KPI and progress is publicly reported in the Air France KLM Universal Registration Document. (See: p.220: https://www.airfranceklm.com/en/system/files/airfranceklm_urd_2021_va_0.pdf)In addition to the absolute 2050 target and the intensity targets, AF has targets on domestic flights, knowingly: 1) Offsetting 100% of CO2 emissions on domestic flights - As of January 1, 2020, Air France has undertaken to offset 100% of the CO2 emissions generated by its domestic flights. This compensation takes the form of participation in projects certified by recognized organizations.2) Reducing CO2 emissions of regional flights in France by 50% by 2024.\n",

According to the target, by 2025 the company will reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 21  per cent (an absolute  target) from the 2016 base year.  In 2021, Alma Media updated the climate targets covering GHG emissions from company operations (scopes 1 and 2), and the subcontracting chain (scope 3), committing to reduce its absolute scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions 52% by 2030 from a 2019 base year and the absolute scope 3 GHG emissions 14% within the same timeframe. The Science Based Targets initiative validated these targets in July 2022 to be in line with a 1.5°C trajectory. In 2021, the goal was not to go higher than 88.3% of the base year's (2016) scope 1 and 2 emissions total emissions.  In scope 3 emissions, the corresponding goal was 92.9 %. The result from 2021 was that Alma Media's combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions fell by 51.9 per cent compared to the reference year (2016), to 544 tCO2eq, calculated using the market-based method. The reported figures have been adjusted to reflect the outsourcing of the delivery operations and the divestment of the regional news media and printing businesses as well as the effect of other restructuring moves and changes in business operations in 2016–2021.Alma Media's science-based Scope 1 and 2 target covers GHG emissions caused by the use of electricity, district heating and district cooling in all Alma Media's properties, and the GHG emissions caused by Alma Media's leased cars.

Therefore, after the company was to reach its earlier Scope 1 and 2 targets, it could formulate a new target based on the calculation done for SBTi. In the reporting year, the company reached its earlier goals and decided to commit to new targets compliant with the 1.5 Celsius degree targets.

Alma Media is one of the first Finnish companies to set long-term, science-based climate targets in line with the methodology outlined by the international Science-Based Target initiative. The SBTi approved the targets in October 2018. In 2021, after reaching its former targets, Alma Media committed to update the climate targets covering GHG emissions from company operations (scopes 1 and 2), and the subcontracting chain (scope 3). Now the company is committed to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions arising from its own operations (Scope 1 & 2) by 52 % and from its subcontracting chain by 14% by 2030.

This is obtained from the projection of activity on passenger-km and ton-km up to 2030 and then multiplying the carbon performance ratio from the baseline and from the expected target. The difference is the announced 31% reduction.Calculation based on the fiscal year's sales-related carbon emissions and their associated passenger.km or ton.km. (Emission factors from  IEA 2019). CO2 emission reduction targets had been reviewed to take into account Alstom new perimeter of activities (with Bombardier Transportation) and is currently reviewe byt the Science Based Targets Initiative. Alstom has committed to reduce the energy consumption of its transport solutions by 35% by 2025 (compared with baseline 2021) measured in gCO2e/ton*km.Alstom has set a key performance indicator to monitor its solutions' energy efficiency. The indicator consolidates the global energy consumption reduction of its portfolio based on a weighted average of the energy consumption reductions from standardised train products – the so-called ''reference solutions” – as well as from those projects. The Company has established standardised methodologies for energy simulations based on sets of assumptions defined for each type of train (mission profile, occupancy, temperature, etc.) in order to ensure the consistency of collected data.In 2021/22, Alstom reported emissions of 9.2 gCO2e per ton.kilometre.\n",

      "This target covers all Amadeus' Scope 1 and 2 emissions worldwide. Amadeus has established objectives to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and become a carbon-neutral growth company.  In 2016 we set a company-wide carbon-neutral growth policy, with 2015 as the baseline year. To make this target more ambitious, our baseline year emissions are net of carbon offsets. Our gross emissions in 2015 without discounting carbon offset were 34,171 tons of CO2  - of which 2,364 tons CO2e were offset, and as already mentioned these are excluded from the base year resulting in 31,807 for our target.We have adapted this objective to make it compatible with our ambition to reduce our emissions to zero by 2050, in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. Accordingly, the objective for 2021 is calculated based on the linear rate of emissions reductions needed from the baseline year to achieve zero emissions by 2050.Since we set the target in 2016, we have implemented measures to reduce emissions. We worked with the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) to offset the emissions that we could not avoid, to reach our target. We invested in Clean Development Mechanism projects in India and offset more than 32,000 tons of CO2, with Certified Emissions Reductions from these projects.In 2019 we took a significant step forward by moving the Data Center to 100% renewable energy. This was achieved through the purchase of Guarantees of Origin of renewable energy. In 2021, with the use of Guarantees of Origin we have reduced our CO2 emissions company-wide (Scope 2) by 75% and delivered net emissions reductions of 34,696 tons of Scope 2 emissions compared to the reported in 2018.  With this more ambitious strategy, direct reductions were achieved.  On the other hand, to meet our 2021 Scope 1 target (1,380 t CO2 emissions), we have offset 581 tons CO2 of our Scope 1 gross emissions (1,961 tons CO2). To offset these emissions we have invested in Clean Development Mechanism projects in India.In 2017 we signed the UN Climate Neutral Pledge. In line with the Paris Agreement on climate change, and by signing the pledge, we commit to become climate neutral by 2050. As 2050 is a very long-term goal, we intend to achieve our target to become carbon neutral by 2030. This target covers all Amadeus' Scope 1 and 2 emissions worldwide. In 2021 we have achieved a reduction of 58.66% CO2e in our combined Scope 1 & 2 from our baseline year thanks to energy efficiency measures, the implementation of 100% renewable energy at the Data Center through Guarantees of Origin (GOs) of renewable energy and the investment in Clean Development Mechanism projects  (offset of 581 tons CO2 emissions of Scope 1).More detailed information on our performance regarding emissions can be found at:https://corporate.amadeus.com/documents/en/corporate-sustainability/report/amadeus_operations_environmental_performance_2021.pdf\n",
      "Amadeus has established objectives to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and become a carbon-neutral growth company. This is aligned with the objective of the Paris Agreement on climate change since on one hand the company  is expected to continue to grow once the effect of the Coronavirus pandemic is passed, whereas our emissions ambition is to be net zero in 2050. The plan is to achieve this goal in different phases. The first one was to achieve carbon neutral growth both in absolute terms and in emissions per employees. Then we have started to deliver emissions reductions and achieve net zero by 2050, although we have an ambition to anticipate our carbon neutrality by 2030.We have achieved our goal to not increase net emissions until 2021 and have exceeded it, managing to deliver net emissions reductions of Scope 2 emissions thanks to energy efficiency measures and the use of Guarantees of Origin. Over the long term, we aspire to become carbon neutral and achieve net zero carbon dioxide emissions. Emissions (Scope 1+2) per employee have been publicly reported including in the Global Report 2021, p. 157. The figure publicly reported for 2021 (856 t Scope1+2 CO2 emissions per employee) has been restated due to the offset of some emissions to meet our Scope 1 target; therefore the kg CO2 per employee (scopes 1 and 2) is 820.2017: 2,890 kg of CO2 per employee (including offset)2018: 1,810 (including offset)2019: 1,0342020: 8562021: 820 (including offset)Therefore,  reduction = ((820/3,121)-1)*100 = -74%  from our baseline yearAnalyzing in more detail our performance, we have reduced Scope 1+2 emissions per employee by 4% (820 tons CO2 per employee in 2021) compared to the previous year (2020). In 2021, with the use of Guarantees of Origin we have reduced our CO2 emissions company-wide (Scope 2) by 75% and delivered net emissions reductions of 34,696 tons of Scope 2 emissions compared to the reported in 2018.

      "In conjunction with others English water companies, in late 2020 Anglian Water committed to become net zero carbon by 2030. We are currently developing our own Anglian Water specific net zero carbon 2030 routemap which we plan to publish in July 2021. This target uses the market based methodology, previously Anglian Water has reported using the location based methodology. By committing to net zero by 2030 we would take the view that this target is aligned to keeping temperatures well below 2 degrees higher than pre-industrial levels but demonstrates our commitment to pursuing a 1.5 degree trajectory.This is our 5-year Gross Operational Carbon emissions target and was set as part of our regulatory requirement.  The regulatory target is 2% each year for 5 years to reach the 10% target in 2025. Given our performance to date we have achieved our 2022 performance target and are on course to achieve our 2025 target. This target has now been complemented by our commitment to achieving net zero carbon by 2030.This is our target to reduce the capital carbon in our 5 yearly investment programme.  Once a project is approved for delivery it's 2010 capital carbon baseline is calculated.  Once the project is completed the actual capital carbon is measured - allowing a % reduction against the baseline to be calculated.  Anglian Water has hundreds of models to support this measurement process.    The long term company target is to achieve a reduction of the total baseline carbon for all the projects in the 2025-2030 investment programme by 70%.  The projects for the 2025-2030 period have not yet been identified.  Therefore, it is not yet possible to confirm the 2010 capital carbon baseline nor current actual capital carbon for the projects in the 2025-2030 period.  The \"Covered emissions...\" have therefore been reported as follows:\"....in base year\" = the 2010 capital carbon baseline for the projects in the 2020-21 period\"...in reporting year\" = the calculated capital carbon at 31/03/21 for the projects in the 2020-21 period The 2015 target was a 50% reduction, the 2020 was 60%, the 2025 is 65% and the 2030 target is 70%.

To keep reporting consistent with previous years, the target above is calculated using the Dutch -local- set of conversion factors (https://www.co2emissiefactoren.nl/). Our new targets on global level are including all Arcadis locations (see our SBT under intensity target \"Int1\").This is our target to buy carbon offsets for our complete footprint (as an interim measure on the way to \"net zero\").

Since then, we have been collecting data and setting targets for lower impact area of our footprint e.g. commute, at the same time as we work to meet the reduction targets for the higher impact areas of our footprint in acknowledgement of this urgency.In 2020 we began working with CDP Supply chain for the first time to measure the carbon in our supply chain. We have continued this membership in FY21. This is an exciting step forward and we have invited our top 500 suppliers to disclose again this year. We have resolved the CDP supply chain data availability lag time issue we highlighted in last year's submission. From FY21 onwards we will apply the previous year's supplier intensity figures to the current year's spend per supplier rather than wait for the current supplier intensity figures to be available via CDP (which would cause a year's delay in our data publication).\n",

This cluster includes emissions related to purchased materials mainly associated with road infrastructure development, maintenance and operation, as well as those related to planned expansion works, which will be dealt with separately given the time gap between when the materials are purchased and the time the new piece of infrastructure goes into operation.  The following two types of activity data were available to quantify emissions related to goods and services emissions:  - kg of materials: for some categories of materials (i.e., cement and concrete, chemicals, paper, glass, metals, plastic and wood), subsidiaries provided data on kg of material purchased in the reference year. They represent the most relevant materials in terms of quantities purchased by the subsidiaries as they are mainly related to highway construction and maintenance works. Emissions are quantified by multiplying the kg of purchased products by the specific EF selected from Ecoinvent 3.8 database.  - monetary expenses: for the remaining goods (and services) for which it wasn't possible to collect physical data, monetary spent from procurement data sheets has been collected. Emissions were calculated using a spend-based method by collecting data on the spent for goods and services purchased and multiplying by relevant EF for the industry categories available in the Exiobase 3.3 EEIO database.

Those targets are an inherent aspect of strategic management and include the upstream supply chain, THE GROUP'S OWN MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS as well as the customers' use phase.The BMW Group has a direct influence on the carbon emissions generated at its own plants and locations and has therefore been a leader in terms of resource efficiency in this field for many years. Its underlying aspiration is even more ambitious than the international pursuing efforts of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees celsius.Despite having already reduced the level of carbon emissions per vehicle produced by more than 70 % since 2006, the BMW Group intends to additionally reduce carbon emissions per vehicle produced, which are generated directly by its own combustion processes (Scope 1) and indirectly by external energy sources (Scope 2), by a further 80 % by 2030 (base year 2019). Accordingly, by 2030 carbon emissions are expected to have dropped by over 90 % compared with 2006 levels. The target boundary includes biogenic emissions and removals from bioenergy feedstocks. From 2021, carbon emissions in accordance with Scope 1 and 2 include not only production-specific emissions, but also those generated at locations not directly related to production.The BMW Group is firmly convinced that the fight against climate change and the responsible use of resources will determine the future of our society – and thus also that of the BMW Group.

The use of science-based targets makes the measurability of our targets transparent and at the same time ensures that they are in line with the latest scientific findings. We have set ourselves the decarbonisation target of carbon reduction during the use phase (Scope 3 downstream) by an average of at least 50 % per kilometer driven to be achieved by 2030 (base year 2019). Thus we again significantly raised the original target of more than 40 % that we had set ourselves. The main reason for this is the dynamic growth in demand for our electrified vehicles.

      "In 2017, BIC launched its new Commitments Program ''Writing the Future, Together.” Three of these five commitments are linked to Climate Change. In particular, the Commitment to use 80% RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY by 2025 is directly linked to the Group's SCOPE 2 MARKET BASED emissions and could be translated into an intensity target. Considering that emissions factors will remain similar between 2015 and 2025 and that production and electricity consumption will increase similarly, the target could be translated into tCO2 emissions (Scope 1 + Scope 2 market based)/ ton of production: to decrease by 50% the indirect CO2 emissions (market based) per ton of production between 2015 and 2025.However, as the target was achieved in 2020, BIC has announced it ambition to go further and aim for 100% electricity from renewable source by 2025.In 2013, BIC set new targets for the 2014-2016 period dealing with emissions from its intra-company transportation activities. Even though the target was set and reached in 2016, BIC continued tracking and communicating about it in 2020, as this was a transition in parallel to the implementation of the new commitments program for 2025 ''Writing the Future, Together.”As air freight is responsible for most of the emissions (70% of GHG emissions for internal freight), the Group decided to focus on the share of transportation by air freight, keeping its percentage below 2.3% each year from 2014 to 2016. This was an ambitious objective, as business and demand are increasing and encounter operational challenges (capacity constraints, planning, forecasts...), tending to push the use of air freight. As the Group's emission efficiency in transport has significantly improved since 2010 (-78% in tCO2/ton of product transported), BIC wants to focus on maintaining its good performance in the upcoming years. This Group target could not be considered a \"business as usual\" target, as constant efforts and action plans will be undertaken to maintain this performance. BIC assumed that the shipped volumes would remain the same between 2013 and 2020, i.e. at 2013 level, and that the share of each type of transport and their emission factors would remain similar to 2013. The objective can be translated in terms of GHG per freight volume and was therefore to be, every year, below the base year emission of 0.109 tCO2/tkm.This target concerns intra-company transport and covers 61% of ''Scope 3: Upstream transportation and distribution,” estimated at 55,900 tCO2eq .\n",

      "During the year we acquired Armadillo, which increased our total emission by 24%. This approx corresponds to the % increase of stores we have added, however, the Armadillo stores are on average 1/3 smaller, so are coming with a higher footprint. This is due to the fact that a number of them heat water with gas.We have restated all of our energy and emission figures and calculated a science based target using this combined footprint. We used Atos to help us calculate our Scope 3 emissions and to set both an absolute (for Scope 1&2) and an intensity based (for Scope 3) target. We have selected the following parameters for our science-based target: -A 70% Scope 1 and 2 reduction commitment (against a baseline year of FY2019/2020); - We will be using Location-based Accounting methodologies; - Use the Absolute Contraction approach; and- Commit to a 1.5°C target.For Scope 3, we have set a Physical Intensity target, targeting 75% of scope. We are aiming slightly higher on the scope to be targeted to ensure the minimum scope of 67% isn't missed.We have set a target year for Scope 1, 2 and 3 of 2032. The targets have been published here https://corporate.bigyellow.co.uk/application/files/8316/5305/0098/BY_FY2021_22_Science_based_Targets.pdf. We intend to submit to the SBTi in July 2022. Our Scope 1 and 2 modelling indicated that the required absolute reduction to meet the SBTi requirements was 46.2%. The Big Yellow Board opted to make this a much more stretching target of 70%. This reflects the Company's investment in on site renewables, the plans to remove gas wherever possible and the intention to move to an electric vehicle.We believe we have not excluded any material emissions; we have made the decision to include our customers' emissions when visiting our stores (as part of Scope 3)\n",
      "This is the first time Big Yellow has set a Scope 3 target; we have elected to set a science  based target which is due to undergo verification by the SBTi in July 2022.Our Scope 3 impact far outweighs our Scope 1 and Scope 2 impacts . Categories 1 and 2 together account for 65% of our Scope 3 emissions, with Downstream T & D accounting for an additional 30odd%. That means the majority of our emissions are embodied within our stores and require close corporation with our Suppliers. There are no material exclusions in our data - the footprint calculations are publicly available in our 'Reports and Case Studies' section of our corporate website.\n",

      "Scope 1+2 was 13% lower than 2016 (base year), meaning that (13/59)*100=22% of the target has been achieved. The relative improvement compared to 2020 was mainly due to improved emission efficiency of purchased energy (Scope 2).The target is:By 2030 the greenhouse gas emissions from BillerudKorsnäs' production and purchased energy shall be at least 59% lower than in 2016.By 2050 the greenhouse gas emissions from BillerudKorsnäs' production and purchased energy shall be at least 74% lower than in 2016.Scope 3 decreased with 16% compared to 2016 (base year), meaning that (16/30)*100=54% of the target has been achieved. The increase in Scope 3 emissions compared to 2020 is due to increased emissions from transport of finished products. This is explained by a significant increase in oversea transportation and also a slight reduction of train use compared to truck use for shorter distances.The target is:By 2030 the greenhouse gas emissions from sources not owned or controlled by BillerudKorsnäs shall be at least 30% lower than in 2016. By 2050 the greenhouse gas emissions from sources not owned or controlled by BillerudKorsnäs shall be at least 70% lower than in 2016.\n",

      "Bloomsbury's Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction target covers all emissions, company wide, relating to our operations.  The figures from this reporting year include emissions linked to the acquisitions of Red Globe Press, Head of Zeus and ABC Clio within the reporting year.Bloomsbury's Scope 3 emissions reduction target is in relation to Category 1, Purchased Goods and Services.  In our base year, this made up 83.3% of our total Scope 3 emissions and so met the target boundary criteria set by the SBTi.  The figures from this reporting year do not include emissions linked to acquisitions as these have not been fully integrated into Bloomsbury's systems.  We will capture them in our 2022/2023 footprint calculations.  In addition, more accurate supplier mapping has meant we've moved certain suppliers from Category 1, Purchased Goods and Services, to Categories 4 and 9, Transportation and Distribution.  Despite moving these suppliers our emissions from Purchased Goods and Services remains within the 2/3 target boundary laid out by the SBTi.\n",

      "As a global player in transport and logistics, Bolloré Logistics has an important role to play to fight against climate change, that is the reason why the Bolloré Group started to define emissions targets for this specific division. Moreover, Bolloré Logistics represents 31% of the greenhouse gas emissions (scope 1&2) of the Group.  Regarding its climate strategy, and with a view to contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, Bolloré Logistics division has drawn on the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBT) to bring its target in line with the 1.5°C threshold. As a result, the Company is committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 43% for scopes 1 and 2 in absolute terms by 2027 for the whole of its network (baseline 2017). Analyzing environmental and social risks, anticipating change while integrating current and future customer's concerns are central to Bolloré Logistics' strategy. The launch of the \"Powering Sustainable Logistics\" Program demonstrates Bolloré Logistics' will to place sustainable development and CSR centre stage of its operational model. Also, it expresses a far-reaching commitment and a genuine wish on our part to join in with those at the forefront of environmental and social value creation through our worldwide supply chain activities. The ''Powering Sustainable Logistics” Program sets 54 targets to be achieved by 2025. They are translated in an action plan deployed per department (real estate, procurement, QHSE, commercial offering ...) but also at local level in each region in which the company operates.Bolloré Logistics division has set up a new objective in 2020 for downstream scope 3 emissions aligned with well-below 2 degrees using sectoral SBT methodology. Downstream scope 3 corresponds to indirect emissions linked with transport execution i.e. 52% of the total carbon footprint of the Group.As a member of the Clean Cargo Working Group and EcoTransIT World, we aim, together with our partners and suppliers, at contributing to industry developments as required, in particular through any available tool and technology conducive to achieving a more responsible supply chain. With some of them, we have been working on long-term projects to bring about tangible and efficient reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and improvement of air quality.The provision of transport services causes significant greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants. While these are mostly indirect emissions from scope 3 downstream, the company has identified this as a major issue. Identified as a risk, it is also a growing opportunity to stand out on markets. GHG emissions from building (warehouses and offices) operations are also overed in the action plans. The same is true for emissions from our own vehicle fleet, which nonetheless accounts for less than 8% of the total volume of goods transported by Bolloré Logistics. Between 2019 and 2017, the emissions decreased by 18,6% due to actions of reduction implemented such as reinforcement of low carbon transport plan support for our customers, training for sales, carbon pacts, new industrialized decision making tools, ad-hoc team working on sustainable innovations within our B.Lab.\n",

In 2025 CEWE shall have a scope 1 + 2 combined CO2 footprint of less than 6700 t CO2 although we anticipate a further growth in output and turnover.CEWE aims to reduce scope 3 CO2 emissions by many different activities in this scope. The clicked ones above show all scope 3 emissions that are porsitive and not zero (the other categories being zero). Only some of the relevant emissions shall be shortlisted here. Main activity is the purchased material, and this being mostly paper, CEWE connects with its paper suppliers to have them reduce their carbon footprint significantly. Here, we strive for 15,000 t CO2e reduction until 2025 (minus 28 %). The same way, CEWE aims at a 3,000 t CO2e reduction for capital goods (minus 40 %). CEWE will change its distribution logistics in due course and estimates a reduction of about 8,000 t CO2e (minus 64 %). The other activities within scope 3 will also be addressed, so that at least 27,000 t of CO2e (25 %) of the total scope 3 CO2 emissions shall be reduced until the year 2025.Due to these activities as well as calculation change and waste management improvements for the \"end-of-life treatment of sold products\" category, the overall scope 3 emissions of CEWE amounts to 89,075 t CO2e (2021).New target from 2021 which covers the scope 1 emissions for heating purposes and concerns the reduction of Gas/Oil for heating purposes.

      "CPIPG tightened its environmental targets for the future – in March 2021, the Group announced its commitment to reduce GHG intensity by 30% by 2030 (across all emissions scopes 1-3)and transition all electricity purchased by the Group to 100% renewable sources by 2024.The target covers the Group's emissions in the selected Scopes that were known and reported for the base year and represent portfolio of built assets in operation. Due to disparity in operational characteristics, environmental disclosure covers built assets in operation and excludes ski resorts (Crans-Montana) and farms (Spojene farmy a.s.). Disclosures relating to built assets in operations represents the vast majority of the Group's assets.Switching electricity purchases to 100% renewable sources is expected to have a marked impact on reducing our overall GHG emissions and intensity in the future since this comprises asignificant portion of the Group's energy mix and today is mostly derived from fossil fuel sources. The switch will also contribute materially to our revised 2030 GHG reduction target.CPIPG teamed up with CI2 initiative to review GHG reporting methodology and its implications to GHG strategy and target setting. The review added another level of transparency and verification to the reporting process and aligned with the GHG Protocol. The updated methodology prepared the Group for its environmental performance disclosure in the CDP.Based on analysis undertaken with our external consultants CI2 and UCEEB, the Group's new GHG reduction target aligns the Group to Paris Agreement climate goals to limit the global temperature increase versus pre-industrial levels to well below 2 degrees centigrade. The set target was sent to SBTi for validation on 15th of May 2021 and in July 2022 was the tightened target (to reduce GHG intensity by 32.4% by 2030 across all emissions scopes 1-3) approved.\n",

The objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions was defined taking into account the analysis of one of the main international trends in this area, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). As such, a simulation was carried out based on the SBTi methodology of sectorial decarbonization ''Service Buildings”, as one of the most suitable methodologies available given the nature of the activities developed. According to the tool's simulation, CGD SA would have to reduce 38% of total GHG emissions (scopes 1 and 2) by 2021, compared to 2015. CGD aspires to be a leader in terms of climate action in the financial system by defining, for this purpose, a more ambitious reduction objective than the one presented by the aforementioned tool, in order to boost the development of projects aimed at reducing GHG emissions. In this way, a level of five percentage points higher than the value simulated by the SBTi tool was assumed, corresponding to a reduction target of 43% of the total GHG emissions of CGD S.A. (Scope 1 and 2) by 2021, compared to 2015. In 2021, CGD achieved a reduction of 73.6% compared to 2015.CGD assumed also the Business Ambition for 1.5ºC commitment, having publicly committed to aligning its business plans to promote the decarbonisation of the economy with the ambition to limit warming to 1.5ºC and Net Zero Banking Alliance.

Through a complete reconstruction of our company, we want to make sure we act within the planetary boundaries with a focus on our climate footprint.We will work with strategic change programs within sourcing, product and assortment, communication, service and aftermarket to reach our goals.An interim target is to reduce emissions relative to our total sales by 50 per cent by the year 2030, which corresponds to 20 per cent in absolute figures. Furthermore, the first two years of our change program will have activity-based targets and thereafter we will measure concrete reductions in emissions based on facts from our value chain.The targets comprise our whole value chain (Scope 1-3). Our value chain includes everything from production and transport to the emissions that a product has when the customer uses it, to end-of-life-treatment. Clas Ohlson does not yet report all emissions in Scope 3 due to the lack of data. In line with our ambition of expanding our reporting, we are gradually adding more categories.\n",

The objective of this ambitious project is to reduce its energy intensity of 30% (compared to the 2017 level) by 2030 to achieve the level of 130 kWh/m². To achieve this objective, a 360-degree approach, which takes the entire life cycle of buildings into account, will be applied.This corporate project concerns both the office and healthcare real estate segments, as well as all activities managed directly within the company such as sales and acquisitions, development, project management and day-to-day management of the buildings.This objective has been established following the science-based targets methodology, which enabled to objectivise the effort to be made in order to contribute to the global objective of limiting global warming to a maximum of 1.5°C. It follows on from  the many ESG initiatives conducted by Cofinimmo, and is actively in line with the Paris Agreement concluded at COP 21.The proxy energy intensity in kWh/m² has been favoured above metric tons CO2e/m² as the first one is easily measurable and does not acquire any conversion factors.

      "Target was set by the end of 2017 and was achieved in 2019. This accounts for a CO2 reduction of 33,800 tonnes, compared to the total location-based Scope 2 emissions. Such a reduction in electricity-associated emissions is aligned with the science-based targets and is found beyond the 1.5C ambition in accordance with the consensus on the current climate science. The target is active, since Coloplast committed to continue annually sourcing 100% renewable electricity through 2025 as part of the SBTi validated target (2022).Coloplast operates a car fleet consisting of around 2,000 cars, which based on fuel consumption emitted 11,500 tonnes CO2e in 2020/21. To reduce its impact, Coloplast will shift to electric company cars with a target of 100% by 2030. This will result in an absolute reduction of emissions of 11,500 tonnes CO2e by 2030, aligned with the 1.5C ambition level.  The target is part of the corporate initiative Strive25 and is aligned with the science-based emission reduction targets which were submitted in 2021 and approved in May 2022. This will be communicated in Coloplast's upcoming sustainability report.Coloplast uses natural gas primarily for facility heating purposes. In 2020/21 the use of natural gas resulted in the total of 11,400 tCO2e reported as scope 1. As part of our Strive25 corporate strategy, Coloplast is planning to phase out use of natural gas, effectively reducing the associated emissions by 100% by 2025. Coloplast's combined scope 1 and 2 100% reduction by 2030 target has been submitted in 2021 and approved in May 2022 by the SBTi. This will be communicated in Coloplast's upcoming sustainability report.\n",
      "As part of our Strive25 strategy, Coloplast has made it a strategic priority to reduce emissions and contribute to accelerating climate action. Coloplast is committed to emission reduction targets in line with limiting global warming to 1.5˚C as outlined in the Paris Agreement. Coloplast commits to reduce scope 3 GHG emissions 50% per product manufactured by 2030 from a 2018/2019 base year. This target has been evaluated and approved by the SBTI in May 2022.Despite growing across all geographies, Coloplast wants to reduce emissions from company air travel by 10% compared to 18/19-levels. Due to Covid-19, the emissions from air travel have been reduced by 81%  compared to 2018/19 levels and well beyond the 10% target. However, once the situation normalises, Coloplast remains committed to limiting air travel to 10% less than 18/19 levels and then freeze. Considering the projected growth of the company, such a reduction in emissions from 2019 levels would lead to intensity-based reduction considered ambitious according to the current SBTi criteria (see SBTi Criteria and Recommendations, V4.2 for details).Coloplast has an ambition to continuously reduce energy used per product produced. In combination with using energy from renewable sources, this is an efficient way Coloplast can reduce climate related impacts from production. During 2020/21, Coloplast has maintained last year's level of energy per product at 0.13 kWh. Despite opening a new factory this year, the energy level is on par due to higher efficiency.\n",

      "In the framework of the Climate Change Conference 2019 (COP 25), held in Madrid, Correos announced its new environmental commitments for 2030, which include reaching carbon neutrality and being zero waste before that year.Among the priority lines of action, this objective stands out: -To achieve total neutrality in CO2 emissions by 2030.For this purpose, Correos has carried out a Cost-Effectiveness analysis (euros/tCO2e) of the different initiatives that Correos can carry out to achieve this objective. The initiatives are framed in three main areas: Buildings (reduction of electrical, stationary fuel consumption and coolant consumption), Transport (Decarbonization of the fleet through the inculcation of alternative vehicles) and Transversal (all types of initiatives that imply a reduction or compensation of emissions). On the other hand, in 2021 Correos has aligned itself with the strategies to reduce the IPC SMMS, of which it is part, for the implementation of different strategies that allow it to reach this target. Correos is currently conducting an internal analysis to set new and more ambitious emission reduction targets, which will be communicated by the end of 2022 or early 2023.  In addition, Correos will carry out (as it has been doing) the compensation of the emissions that it cannot reduce through the different strategies with the aim of being carbon neutral.Correos is part of the IPC SMMS Group. For this reason, Correos has aligned its emission reduction targets with the group. The main objective within this Group is to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030, taking into account 2019 as the base year. All Correos facilities are taken into account as scope.Correos is part of the IPC SMMS group, which is why it has aligned itself with its emission reduction targets. The objective of this target is to reduce direct greenhouse gas emissions from the vehicle fleet (road) used by Correos by 50% by 2030, which will reduce the scope 1 of Correos' carbon footprint and contribute to local and global decarbonization process. During 2021 and 2022, Correos is conducting an internal analysis to set new and more ambitious emission reduction targets, which will be communicated by the end of 2022 or early 2023.\n",
      "As members of the International Post Corporation's (IPC) Sustainability Measurement and Monitoring System (SMMS) programme Correos is aligned with the IPC sector level target of a 20% reduction between 2013 and 2025 of the intensity of emissions per letter and package.This initiative has been presented in the framework of the scientifically based targets to limit the number of heating to just two degrees, on the line of the Paris agreement signed in 2015.This target considers approximately 50% of the company's total emissions by 2021. Emissions associated with business travel and employee commuting have been excluded in this indicator, given that these emissions do not need to be distributed by-product since they do not directly influence operations. In this sense, the indicator in 2021 has been 442.66 gCO2/item (parcel), 70% less than in the base year (1,434gCO2/item). For this reason, it is determined that 100% of the target set has been archived.This reduction target follows the line established in the ''General Sustainability Plan 2014-2020 of Correos”, which bets on a more efficient distribution through new technologies and fuels; optimization of energy needs of the centers; employee awareness, and the reduction of the distances traveled necessary for the service.Given that after 8 years from the base year, it has been possible to reduce by 70% the indicator, if Correos continue working on the abovementioned objectives, by 2025 Correos will have achieved a reduction of 122% in relative terms. This is totally linked to the absolute objectives proposed.\n",

      "The Scope 3 emissions intensity target of 52% considers the company's ambitious growth plans and reduces emissions intensity year-on-year per square meter of housing completed. The intensity target does not result in an absolute growth in emissions.We considered various activities to achieve emissions reduction when developing our Scope 3 target. Due to the nature of housebuilding, the majority of the Scope 3 emissions result from the energy consumption by the occupants of the housing during a 60-year timeframe. Countryside Properties can influence emissions here by improving building design and specifications. Some of the measures we considered were replacing fossil fuel heating systems with renewable alternatives (e.g. natural gas boilers with air source heat pumps), increasing the provision of solar panel capacity per m2 of dwelling, and other measures such as waste heat recovery and electrification of domestic hot water demands. These measures are expected to reduce emissions arising from the regulated in-use energy consumption by ~80%. This reduction is in line with the expected update to the English building regulations via the Future Homes Standard.The embodied emissions of the materials used in the construction of the homes is the next largest contributor to the Scope 3 emissions. To reduce these emissions, Countryside is planning to increase the share of homes constructed by modern methods of construction (MMC) using timber frame construction. We have set a target of at least 50% of homes to be constructed through MMC, this will be achieved by ramping up the timber frame manufacturing facilities capacity to meet the demand. Timber frame construction has lower embodied carbon than traditional masonry-built homes.Overall, we feel that in considering our ambitious growth plans, we have a strong basis on which to propose this target to reduce emissions within our Scope 3 value chain, and a clear understanding of how we can meet it.\n",

It includes the common areas of the multi-let buildings in France and Italy. It also includes all the energy consumptions related to our own activity, that is to say our headquarter buildings in Germany, Italy and France. All the information can be found on the EPRA table published at the end of our 2020Annual Report on Sustainable Performance. This information has been used for the calculation of our SBT, in accordance with the works we have made with the CSTB, and verified by EY.We noticed a slow reduction this year due to new acquisitions, especially hotels with high services, intensive in energy consumption. We also have changed the representative panel for the German portfolio to improve the representativeness following the recent acquisitions in Berlin.

The works with the CSTB, based on sectoral information, experience, business analysis, Life-Cycle Assesments..., have led us to determine the emissions related to the construction and renovation of the buildings.Scope 3 also includes the energy consumption related to the assets we own but on which we have no operational control, it includes the residential activity in Germany, the Hotel activity in Europe and offices in France in Italy (Tenant part of the multi-let buildings and the single-let buildings).  These two aspects are the most material for Covivio, on which we can have an impact given the choices we can make and the strategy we can implement, both \"Downstream leased assets\" and \"Capital Goods\" items are accounting for 83.9% of our Scope 3 emissions. In order to proceed to such analysis, we also have calculated the other Scope 3 emissions: Purchased goods and services, waste generated in operations, business travel, employee commuting; but we decided to not include it in our 2030 target.Our calculations have been made by taking into account assumptions about the expected growth of our portfolio for each activity.

The target covers Scope 1 and 2 emissions across CIÉ Group's Operating Companies (Bus Átha Cliath, Iarnród Éireann, Bus Éireann, CIÉ Tours) and the Holding Company, with no exclusions.In previous years, CIÉ Group had focused on tracking and reporting emissions data from Bus Átha Cliath, Iarnród Éireann, and Bus Éireann, as their Scope 1 and 2 emissions represented over 99.99% of the CIÉ Group's Scope 1 and 2 emissions. In 2021, CIÉ Group expanded our climate-related reporting to also include Scope 1 and 2 emissions calculations from the Holding Company and CIÉ Tours, despite their smaller carbon footprint.The base year for this target is 2018, and CIÉ Group is still in the process of calculating the 2018 Scope 1 and 2 emissions for CIÉ Tours and the Holding Company. However, since CIÉ Tours and the Holding Company represented approximately 0.005% of the Group-wide emissions in 2021, we estimate that the impact of CIÉ Tours and the Holding Company on overall emissions was similarly insignificant in 2018 and are using the emissions from Iarnród Éireann, Bus Éireann, and Bus Átha Cliath as the 2018 baseline. The base year figure will be revised as we calculate the emissions from CIÉ Tours and the Holding Company from historical data.\n",

Despite the proved good results in Carbon Intensity, total emissions are increased but this is due to ships number which was increased from 63 to 69 in 2021. An additional factor that proves good performance and success of optimization efforts is the total emissions/total DWT that shows the weighted results and provide the confidence that results will be successful.Scope 2 carbon emissions reduction at this stage was achieved by the power suppliers efforts to provide more green electricity. That is shown in the official declarations of Carbon Factor per kWh.\n",

Company however, sets an additional stricter target, that of 47.5% CI reduction, 5 years earlier, in 2025. That is the official commitment mentioned to Sustainability (ESG) report 2021 too. The main reason of setting new target that has to be achieved earlier, aims towards further reduction of CI to 60% in 2030, in case further development of green fuels production, ships design and infrastructure, will follow. Regarding the 2021 results, it has to be noted that was a special year for shipping worldwide, directly affected by COVID-19 and ports congestions. However, even with high speed average in 2021, CI reduction is still in the range of 40%. Following round discussions with  stakeholders (clients, Flag administrations and Classification societies), speed is expected to return to last 5 year average values, even lower, when EEXI and CII rating will be in force in 2023. Positive results are the outcome of a number of combined actions such as speed and route optimization, retrofits and tunings, new technologies application and of course very strict monitoring.

The methodological changes are explained in the part C5. 2. This (Abs 1) target was active over Jan-Sept 2021 until the validation by SBTi of a revised and more ambitious target that became active over Sept-Dec 2021 period (see Abs 2 target below)We revised the absolute 1 target to make it more ambitious. The absolute contraction methodology has been used for scopes 1 and 2. The minimum required for the 1.5° scenario is -42% over 10 years.

In 2020 we therefore decided to revise the -40% KPI target for two mains reasons :1) To be aligned with the Paris Agreement and secure the Science Based target validation.2) To focus on CO2/value added rather than CO2/product (given the heterogeneity of our product mix)In line with SBTi requirements,  the absolute contraction methodology has been used for scopes 1 and 2.

For this sector no science-based targets methodology could be identified.Percentage of emissions in scope relates to the LH Group aircraft fleet (passenger and cargo). Note: special reduction effect caused by the output reduction due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Target aligns with the IATA industry goal of reducing absolute carbon emissions by 50% by 2050, compared to 2005 levels. This target was replaced by IATA in October 2021 by an adopted IATA resolution that commits the global aviation sector (IATA member airlines) to reducing its net carbon emissions to zero by 2050. The Lufthansa Group played a major role in setting the IATA target.In March 2019 the Lufthansa Group Executive Board adopted the goal of supplying 100% of LHG electricity consumption in fully and directly owned or rented buildings in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Belgium with 100% green electricity from 2020 onwards. To this end, LHG has acquired renewable energy from renewable power plants (as in Austria, Switzerland and Belgium) or by acquiring green power certificates (HKN Neu 100, in Germany), which guarantee the production of green electricity from 100% new power plants, thus contributing to the expansion of renewable energy.In March 2019, the Lufthansa Group Executive Board adopted the goal of transition into CO2-neutral mobility on the ground in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Belgium until 2030. That means that LHG aims to switch own ground vehicles used at the airports in these countries to a low carbon energy. This is including also the switch to 100 % carbon neutral electricity at all LHG facilities in these home market countries as soon as possible (see target C4.2a Low1). The switch to 100 % carbon neutral electricity has been started in January 2020.   Note: special reduction effect caused by the output reduction due to the COVID-19 pandemic.As part of LHG´s long-term net zero by 2050 commitment, LHG has also set medium-term climate targets. In 2021, Lufthansa Group is committed to mitigate its net Scope 1 emissions by 50 % until 2030 vs. 2019 by a variable ratio of reductions and compensations. The reduction from fleet renewal, operational and air traffic management efficiency and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is derived from the Science-based intensity target and depends on the future RTK growth. From today's perspective, the projected growth leads to an absolute reduction of 17,65 %. The remaining 32,35 % to the target will rely on compensation. However, the ratio of reduction and compensation will change with any change in forecasted RTK production growth.\n",

This is subject to development of the right technical solution and regulatory support from UK Government. This target covers all of the business' scope 1 and 2 emissions, including the operations of Generation, Pellet Production and Customers. Since the target was set in 2021, the SBTi rules included the acquisition of pinnacle into the 2020 base figures and excluded the divestment of the gas power stations. The target also includes all sources of emissions calculated, without a materiality threshold. This target is separate to our sectoral decarbonisation target applied to the Scope 1 & 2 emissions of our generation assets. We submitted our SBTi targets for validation in 2021 to achieve specific reductions in Scope 1, 2 and 3 by 2030. We have self-validated our target as science based, which is currently in the SBTi validation process.This covers all scope 3 emissions that are stipulated in our basis of reporting . We follow the SBTi rules of accounting, therefore the assets (CCGTs) that we sold in 2021 were not included.\n",

On advice from the Science based targets initiative, DCU aims for an absolute reduction of 4.2% annually on all scopes 1, 2 & 3 across all campuses and operations.. However, compared to our base year of 2018 we well exceeded our target in 2020 with a reduction of 43%. This was largely due to a dramatic fall in construction in DCU but also COVID restrictions had a major impact on the normal operational functioning of the university. However, DCU still targets a 4.2% absolute reduction of emissions in 2021 and 2022.\n",

Biogenic emissions are insignificant and have not been reported. The reporting is performed in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, and includes Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions. This entails that we will exceed the Paris Agreement. The approach chosen for consolidating greenhouse gas emissions extends from ''operational control” to encompass all categories of the GHG protocol that exceed 1 per cent and are therefore considered significant.\n",

Through our different products, Elekta provides radiation oncology to patients worldwide. Background to Elekta's selected unit: Global cancer incidence is increasing annually, meaning that the need for radiotherapy treatments is growing. Access to cancer treatment differs globally: mature markets have more cancer treatment infrastructure available per capita than immature markets where treatment infrastructure is lacking. Access to cancer care remains a problem in all markets. Given the required radiotherapy treatment growth to close the cancer care access gap, Elekta intends to decouple emissions from the number of treatment courses delivered. Elekta intends to increase cancer access and make cancer treatments more environmentally efficient, and hence aims to measure emissions from use and processing of sold products per cancer treatment course. By tracking emissions per cancer treatment course, Elekta promotes more environmentally efficient solutions to treating cancer globally.

This allowed to understand what the main poles of greenhouse gas emissions and therefore to identify the 3 levers for improvement were: energy, food waste and menu design.The Group's objective is to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions per meal by 12% by the fiscal year 2024-2025 (compared to the fiscal year 2019-2020) on its direct emissions (scope 1 and 2) but also on its indirect emissions generated in its value chain by its activities (scope 3). Elior is thus a player in transforming its business towards more environmentally friendly practices by establishing good practices in a sustainable manner.To do so, Elior has identified three lever of improvements. The first one is the energy. Elior commits to source 80% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2025 and to reduce its energy consumption. Regular energy audits carried out at our sites make it possible to identify concrete levers of action. Elior has implemented a lot of initiatives in this domain over the years. Secondly, Elior is taking action to combat food waste. All the countries where Group is present deploy anti-waste programs and our global objective is to reduce this waste by 30% by 2025. In France and Spain, for example, Elior has forged a partnership with Too Good To Go to offer employees the opportunity of purchasing take-outs of surplus unconsumed canteen lunches. Thirdly, reducing the carbon impact of our recipes where the actions implemented differ from one country to another. Indeed, we do not cook in the same way in France and in the USA. Indeed, in the USA, where a great amount of beef is consumed, Elior will seek to replace this animal protein with other less carbon-intensive. In France, on the other hand, because the demand for vegetarian cuisine is growing, French chefs will be required to offer more and more vegetarian meals.

      "Eurazeo's long-lasting commitment to tackle climate issues has been strengthened in 2020 with the ambitious O+ engagement to become carbon net neutral by 2040 at the latest. Eurazeo aims to align its activities with a scenario limiting global warming to a 1.5°C threshold. This commitment led us to establish reduction targets which are calculated using a world-renowned scientific methodology: Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). At management company level, the scope 1 and 2 objectives, validated per SBTi's scientific committee, are the following:  • 2025: Eurazeo commits to increase annual sourcing of renewable electricity from 9% in 2017 to 80%  • 2030: Eurazeo commits to reduce scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 82% per employee from a 2017 base year.  Regarding reduction of scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, both absolute (gross scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions) and intensity (scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions per employee) sub-targets have been presented to the SBTI. These targets have been submitted and approved by the SBTI during 2021.Most scope 3 emissions being dependent on our portfolio companies, another target is to screen 100% of our investments' emissions and to engage 25% of the invested capital to set science-based by 2025 and 100% by 2030.Eurazeo undertakes to reduce the GHG emissions of its Real Estate activity by 60% per square meter by 2030, with 2021 as base year and to ensure that 25% of its Private Equity portfolio that is eligible in terms of invested capital have decarbonization pathways validated by SBTi by 2025, and 100% by 2030.Out of scope from its SBTi commitment, in 2022 Eurazeo has defined a 30% absolute reduction target by 2030 compared to 2019 levels for its ''purchased services” and business travel” scope 3 emissions. This impact for our ''purchased services” and ''Business Travel” is relatively small (0,3%) compared to the emissions generated at portfolio level, but nonetheless, reducing GHG emissions at Eurazeo level remains a key action in our climate strategy. Set a 30% reduction target by 2030 for these Scope 3 categories will be considered as a material contribution to be aligned with Paris Agreement Goal. This implies a 2.7% absolute reduction per year between 2019 and 2030.\n",

In line with our sustainability commitments, we have committed to measuring and reporting our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions (Fig 1). We are also committed to carbon neutrality by end 2021, and offsetting our historic carbon footprint since inception through investing in nature-based solutions. We are committed to achieving net zero emissions no later than 2040, including for scope 3 emissions. We intend to do this in line with the Science Based Targets (SBTi) methodology and have engaged with the SBT Initiative on this basis for verification, and to ultimately achieving a net-negative goal by investing in nature-based solutions. According to guidance from the SBTi,  we have used 2019 as our base year because this represents business as usual.Using a markets-based approach to calculation, carbon emissions in 2020 fell some 60% from 2019 levels.  This was largely as a result of significantly reduced air travel, which made up around 70% of our emissions in 2019. FNZ's Scope 1+2 intensity has been ranked 6 out of the 124 firms compared within the Compare Your Footprint industry group of comparable organisations. In 2020, whilst energy consumption of data centres made up 54.9% of our energy usage, these are powered by 100% renewable sources; contributions to emissions from business travel (Scope 3) remain a significant contribution to our overall footprint as well as increased office space acquired to support the growing business. Based on our observations over the previous three  year period, areas for achieving reductions centre on the following:Reducing air travel, especially higher class travel. This transition was demonstrated effectively in the reduction in emissions from 2019 - 2020 through ensuring that appropriate online meeting facilities were available to conduct ongoing business. The resilience of this infrastructure was notable and should stand the firm in good stead as conditions return to normal.The transition of technological architecture to the cloud, a development that is currently in progress. This concerns the energy use change in moving away from storing and processing information in local networks and moving toward outsourcing these tasks to centralised facilities (off-site servers) where the benefits of efficiencies of scale can be harnessed, reducing the overall need for more computers.The creation of a central database for all energy and environmental consumption figures, f-gases and business travel figures for all offices globally, in order to enable the collection of more granular information to improve accuracy of footprint. FNZ has elected to become a voluntary signatory to the Carbon Disclosure Project and to report in line with TCFD on climate-related risks and opportunities within our Sustainability Report.\n",

      "We have implemented a strict global travel policy, which builds on the successes of our Continental Europe (CE) travel policy, in order to meet the firm's own targets, as well as our Science Based Targets which are pending validation at this time. Some of the key features of our travel policy include a bias against travel (thanks to improved technology for virtual meetings), train before plane, and economy seats on flights less than 7 hours (rather than selecting business class).  We are also working with our travel providers to help reduce unnecessary air travel. In previous years, we set up a travel working group with stakeholders across our international offices to help reduce unnecessary business travel and understand risks and opportunities. We also assess and estimate the carbon footprint created by travel for conferences and events held in different locations, with the aim of selecting the least carbon intensive destinations.All technological changes required are already in place or budgeted as part of a global efficiency drive.  For instance Microsoft Teams has been rolled out across all our offices and we have successfully hosted many virtual events and conferences (and legal hearings).We are measuring our carbon footprint in each office and working with each office for energy efficiency improvements and we are investing in renewable electricity. We are committed to RE100 with a target year of 2030. We have also included this as a Science Based Target pending validation.We have introduced measures in each office such as; removing personal printers, automatically setting the printers to double sided printing and agile working (no one has their own desk which is shown to reduce paper use as a result of a more digital way of working).We are collecting data on plastic use from each office and engaging with the office environmental coordinators to phase these out gradually. Every employee was issued with a reusable coffee cup on World Environment Day in 2018. Examples of some key initiatives include plastic cups being taken out from the kitchen areas and being replaced with glasses and mugs. We will have to caveat this target in the short-term due to safety and hygiene concerns as a result of COVID-19 but any disposable items brought in will be a temporary measure only.  We are still committed to engaging with all of our office coordinators to phase out single -use plastic plates, food containers, cups, cutlery and straws as a minimum. As of April 2021, only five of our offices had stocks of single-use plastic items remaining. For four offices (Manchester, Washington, Beijing and Shanghai) these items are a surplus being used up, after they were purchased for hygiene reasons during the pandemic. Our London office still has a need for single-use plastics due to the large FTE and requirement for employees to be able to grab refreshments conveniently. Initiatives are in place to encourage the use of crockery, and to discourage the use of single-use plastics (ie a levy charge to employees choosing these items). It is important to note that if employees prepare single-use plastic items properly before entering the waste stream, the items are 100 per cent recyclable.\n",

The reduction is primarily connected to electricity where Fristad both consumed less (-17% due to the Covid pandemic), but also increased the share of electricity produced by renewable sources during the year. The emissions from electricity were reduced by 77% since last year.The reduction is also driven by a decrease in car driving where only necessary trips were made due to the pandemic, which reduced the traveling by 35%. However, company operated vehicles still represent the largest source of emissions 2020. Some emissions related to refrigerant leaks also contributes to the reduction. Refrigerant leaks have earlier been assumed, but have now been measured and confirmed as non-existent.The emission per net revenue/FTE and area all decreased largely. That is connected to the decreased emissions and increased revenue and number of employees.  In order to reduce their emissions further Fristad could continue to change to more climate friendly electricity sources in their facilities and continue moving to more climate friendly alternatives when travel is necessary.

Claims  are settled either in the form of cash compensation or by repairing the damage with the help of our suppliers, which involves the consumption of materials and where we as a company become liable for the residual value. Our claims expenses also include elements of recourse (compensation from others when we settle a claim onbehalf of our customers, but where others are liable for the loss). Sustainable claims settlements mean that we shall ensure a higher degree of reuse and promote thecircular economy, but also contribute to good working conditions among our suppliers. In 2019, we established a starting point for measuring CO2 equivalents (CO2e)based on our model for estimating consumption of materials in motor and property claims. The biggest climate footprint in our claims processes is driven by motorinsurance. The CO2e related to waste is limited, reflecting the fact that our agreements with car dismantlers are conditional on a very high degree of recycling of materials.Furthermore, vehicle condemnations are settled in cash, which means they are not currently within our scope of influence.

      "In 2019, Fnac Darty worked to create a low-carbon pathway that complies with the global pathway defined by the Paris Climate Agreement.In June 2021, Fnac Darty committed to setting science-based targets across the Group's entire carbon footprint, with the definition of near-term targets. The targets set for Fnac Darty, which was submitted for approval at the beginning of 2022, are a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 compared to 2019 for scopes 1 and 2 (Group scope) and a commitment requiring suppliers representing 72% of the Group's scope 3 CO2 emissions to have defined science-based reduction targets.For scope 1 and 2, no exclusion are to be reported since Fnac Darty worked to recalculate past exclusions.  Primary activities and operations that account for emissions in scope 1 are: direct emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels, from fixed source (gas or domestic fuel used primary at logistic sites) and from mobile source (company cars and owned-delivery trucks) and direct fugitive emissions. Primary activities and operations that account for emissions in scope 2 are: consumption of electricity, heat and cold. Although Nature & Découvertes joined the Group in mid-2019, the choice was made to consider all the subsidiary's emissions in 2019 to calculate the base-year.The target was defined in 2019 in accordance with the recommendations of the Science Based Targets (SBT) initiative. The sector-wide approach was preferred, based on the tools of the Sectorial Decarbonization Approach (SDA) developed by the International Energy Agency. Due to the lack of 1.5°C scenario data from IEA, SBTi currently does not provide an SDA option for 1.5°C targets, so the Absolute Contraction Approach was also used. The target coverage include emissions related to energy consumption (electricity, heating, cooling) and transportation (car companies and business travels, last-mile delivery trucks, freight transportation from warehouses to stores, parcels' deliveries, transportation of out-of-service products from stores to repair workshops). Upstream transportation of goods from manufacturing sites to our warehouses were not included in the target.Fnac Darty chose to address this GHG emission categories because it considers that they are the most direct emission (though they are not considered direct in the GHG Protocol classification). Indeed, downstream and upstream transportation (at least the transportation of goods from warehouses to stores) are managed as direct operations, thus we consider that we  have direct levers to reduce the associated GHG emissions, even though those transportation are subcontracted.Although Nature & Découvertes joined the Group in mid-2019, the choice was made to consider all the subsidiary's emissions in 2019 to calculate the base-year.\n",

      "FS Group's target to be climate neutral by 2040 has been approved by FS's Board of Directors in 2022, that has increased the ambition from the previous target of carbon neutrality in 2050 that was related just to operations in Italy. FS Italiane Group aims to become carbon neutral by 2040, for the energy consumed by Group companies that operate in Italy (including rail traction, road transport, road infrastructure lighting and consumption in buildings like stations, offices and workshops). Foreign companies, which at the moment cover a minor part of the business, are excluded.The percentage of covered emissions represents the total emissions (100%) in the base year (2019), equal to 2,746,059 tCO2e, sum of Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based emissions, object of the target. In 2021, the reporting year, the covered emissions amounts to 1,877,968 tCO2e.After the significant fall in emissions in 2020, mainly due to the decrease in service operations because of the restrictions on mobility of people caused by epidemic emergency, in 2021 emissions covered by the target have still decreased, despite a partial recovery of transport operations that has caused a slight increase in energy consumption.The target has not been approved by Science Based Target Initiative, nevertheless, according to the Absolute Emissions Contraction method, the target may be still considered as science-based because in linear terms, the average annual reduction rate of emissions required by the target is higher than 2.5%, the annual reduction required by well-below 2°C scenario, and aligned with net-zero as long term target.In any case, FS Group has set another medium-term target of decarbonization that is science-based and will be presented to Science Based Target Initiative to be validated.At the end of 2021, FS Group introduced the new Industrial Plan, approved by all internal companies: throughout the Plan, which covers the period 2022-2031, FS Group pursues the target of reducing CO2 emissions by 50%, including both Scope 1 and  Scope 2, within 2030. Specifically,  total emissions covered by target in all selected Scopes, considered in the base year (2019),  is equal to 2,746,059 t CO2e. This value embodies CO2e emissions produced by all companies of the Group,  and it is composed by Scope 1 (655,554 CO2e) and Scope 2 (2,090,505 CO2e).However, in 2021, the reporting year, the total of covered emissions  by all companies of the FS Group amounts to 1,877,968 tCO2e.Following the significant fall in emissions in 2020, mainly due to the decrease in service operations because of the restrictions on mobility of people caused by epidemic emergency, in 2021 emissions covered by the target have still decreased, despite a partial recovery of transport operations that has caused a slight increase in energy consumption. FS identified the objective of reducing emissions of scope 1 and scope 2, by 50%, within 2030, aligning to the target ambition 1.5 ° C scenario. Currently, FS is working on the presentation of this goal for the validation of the Science Based Target Initiative, within next two years.At the end of 2021, FS Group drew up the new Industrial Plan, approved by all internal companies: throughout the Plan, which covers the period 2022-2031, FS Group pursues the target of reducing CO2 Scope 3 emissions by 30%, within 2030. Specifically,  total emissions covered by target in all selected Scopes, considered in the base year (2019),  is equal to 5,450,609 t CO2e. This value embodies CO2e emissions produced by all companies of the Group,  and it is composed by Scope 1 (655,554 CO2e) and Scope 2 (2,090,505 CO2e).However, in 2021, the reporting year, the total of covered emissions  by all companies of the FS Group amounts to 5,698,801 tCO2e.Following the significant fall in emissions in 2020, mainly due to the decrease in service operations because of the restrictions on mobility of people caused by epidemic emergency, in 2021 emissions covered by the target have still decreased, despite a partial recovery of transport operations that has caused a slight increase in energy consumption.

This treaty was officially presented at the meeting also attended by the Chair of the FS Italiane Group. The commitment concerns a comprehensive Green Transformation of European Railways including all aspects of sustainability (climate and environmental protection, circular economy, ecodesign, energy transition).The target, in emissions terms, is to reduce rail transport GHG emissions by 30% in 2030 compared to 2015 and reach climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest, and further improve our energy efficiency (already increased by 22% since 1990) by 25% between today and 2050, notably through:- A more energy-efficient use of our assets (eco-driving, on-board electricity meters, energy consumption reduction during commercial stops or in standstill, investment in even more sustainable rolling stock, Digital Capacity Management, Digital Automatic Coupling);- Greening further of our electricity mix;- Complete decarbonisation of rail operations by complementing further electrification with investments in alternative propulsion technologies such as battery, hybrid, hydrogen or biofuel trains when electrification is too costly.\n",
      "FS includes greenhouse gas emissions targets in remuneration policies since 2019. In 2021 top management and each position subject to remuneration policies, including CEO of the holding company and CEOs of the subsidiaries, have been evaluated according to carbon performances, assessed as a ratio between the economic value generated in € by the whole FS Group and the total CO2 emissions. At the numerator, the economic value generated is the sum of economic value distributed and retained by FS Group. The CO2 emissions, reported at the denominator, represent the 98.07% respect to the total CO2 equivalent emissions of the Group, related to all greenhouse gases, considering the location-based approach for Scope 2. The indicator, due to its ratio, provides a target that increases if the performances achieve a general CO2 emission reduction.

Becoming carbon neutral is achieved by means of prevention, reduction and compensation of carbon emissions, each with a set target. HMC will begin by investing in carbon offsetting projects that align with its mission to create sustainable value(s). These will be certified carbon reduction projects that are already in development with the accredited Climate Neutral Group. By the end of 2020, HMC has begon offsetting 100% of its existing offshore carbon footprint, equaling 272280 metric tons of carbon per year. From this starting point, Heerema has set yearly prevention and reduction targets.

      "The Paris Agreement on climate change represents a commitment by the community of nations to limit global warming to significantly less than two degrees Celsius. To achieve this, carbon dioxide emissions must be reduced by 80 to 90 percent by 2050. Henkel is committed to the two-degree target: For this reason, We aim to reduce the carbon footprint of our production by 75 percent by 2030 (base year: 2010). We are starting by focusing on our own production, which we can influence directly. We also want to continually improve our energy efficiency and draw 100 percent of the electricity we use from renewable sources. The raw materials we purchase also have a decisive impact on our carbon footprint along the value chain. For this reason, we expect our suppliers and contract partners to set efficiency targets that are as ambitious as our own – and contribute to the reduction of CO2 along the value chain. We are working on a joint road map to achieve this. In addition, we want to leverage the potential of our brands and technologies to help our customers and consumers to save 100 million metric tons of CO2 over during the ten-year period from 2016 to 2025. Our analysis shows that the product use phase has the greatest impact on our carbon footprint – and our products are used millions of times every day in households and industrial processes.The assumption for the change in anticipated absolute scope 1+2 emissions is based on an average growth of 1% per year, combined with an average efficiency increase of about 5 percent per year.Henkel has the 20-year goal for 2030 to triple the value it creates for the environmental footprint made by its operations, products and services. To reach this goal of becoming three times more efficient by 2030, Henkel has to improve the efficiency by an average of 5 to 6 percent each year.   In 2020, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) confirmed that our science-based emissions reduction targets, which we derived based on our long-term goals, are consistent with the initiative's criteria. Henkel commits to reduce scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 67 percent per ton of product by 2030 from a 2017 base year. Also, we have converted our existing climate targets with the reference year 2010 accordingly to the more current reference year 2017, because of major acquisitions that strongly influenced our production volume. We assumed a 1%/a growth of our production volume until 2030.The Science Based Targets initiative by the UN Global Compact, World Resources Institute, World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF) and Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) aims at encouraging companies to set such targets. The targets covering greenhouse gas emissions from Henkel's operations (scopes 1 and 2) are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement.Non-production sites are excluded from this target, these include for example office buildings, warehouses and R&D activities.In accordance with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Henkel derived its own science-based emission reduction targets based on its long-term targets. The Science Based Targets initiative by the UN Global Compact, World Resources Institute, World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF) and Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) aims at encouraging companies to set such targets. We developed our science-based targets in 2019 and they were approved in March 2020 by the initiative as consistent with levels required to meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.We commit to reduce scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods and services 30% per ton of product by 2030 from a 2017 base year. We assumed a 1%/a growth of our production volume until 2030. This target meets the SBTi's criteria for ambitious value chain goals, meaning they are in line with current best practice. The emissions from raw materials and packaging (purchased goods and services) represent more than 90 % of the direct emissions within Henkel's scope 3 and almost 90% of the overall company footprint (excluding indirect use phase emissions).By adopting the Paris Climate Agreement, the UN member states made a commitment to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit this increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Henkel is committed to helping to reach this target. For this reason, we will follow the long-term vision of becoming a climate-positive company by 2030 and making an active and committed contribution to climate protection. We are starting by focusing on our own production, which we can influence directly. We aim to reduce the carbon footprint of our production by 65 percent by 2025. We also want to continually improve our energy efficiency and draw 100 percent of the electricity we use from renewable sources. The assumption for the change in anticipated absolute scope 1+2 emissions is based on an average growth of 1% per year, combined with an average efficiency increase of about 5 percent per year.Non-production sites are excluded from this target, these include for example office buildings, warehouses and R&D activities.Our responsibility along the entire value chain includes optimizing our transport and logistics processes in terms of environmental compatibility and resource efficiency. We set ourselves the overall aim to reduce the emissions from transporting our products by around 15 percent per ton of product between 2015 and 2025. We also aim to use renewable electricity at 50 percent of our pallet spaces within Henkel-operated warehouses by 2025. Our logistics emissions have been calculated using a new methodology developed by our service provider ETW since 2021. By recalculating the values for the previous year, we intend to have in place a method for reliably tracking progress made towards the target. Progress in the previous target period from 2015 to 2020 is not affected.\n",

      "GHG emitted by the Office Property Investment Division was 15 492 tonnes of CO2 in 2021, ie 6% of total Icade's carbon footprint (which also comprises Health Property Investment Division and Property Development Division).The Office Property Investment Division set a goal to reduce its carbon intensity by 45% between 2015 and 2025, i.e. -5.8% per year, in line with a 1.5°C pathway.This commitment covers emissions from the overall energy consumption of the buildings, including controlled consumption (common areas of buildings) and non-controlled consumption (private areas and single-tenant buildings), i.e. scopes 1, 2 and 3 relating to the buildings' energy consumption.The rise in 2021 compared to 2020 is largely due to higher office occupancy rates (fewer lockdowns than in 2020) and the increase in consumption related to ventilation to address health concerns. It was mitigated by development and renovation projects that were added to the portfolio in 2021.Icade office Property Investment Division's intensity dropped by 30% between 2015 and 2021.The downward trend over the 2015 - 2021 period can mostly be explained by the sale of assets whose energy and carbon intensity was high and the acquisition of more energy efficient assets. It is also attributable to energy efficiency measures such as energy performance contracts, LED lighting, green lease committees and the increased use of renewable energy.The new climate strategy, as well as the biodiversity strategy, will be the subject of a ''Say on Climate and Biodiversity” resolution at the General Shareholders' Meeting on April 22,2022.A dedicated ''climate” report has been published to explain these new low-carbon commitments.Icade has also expressed its intention to have its new reduction targets (2019 - 2030) validated by the Science-Based Target initiative.In 2021, Icade Santé defined its pathway to reduce the carbon intensity of its assets in France, with a target reduction of 37% between 2019 and 2030, in line with a 1.5°C pathway.Icade Sante carbon intensity dropped by 2% between 2015 and 2021.GHG emitted by the Health Property Investment Division was 62,456 tonnes of CO2 in 2021, ie 20% of total Icade's carbon footprint (which also comprises Office Property Investment Division and Property Development Division).

This target is related to ISDIN's sustainability goals (Blue Wave program), more specifically with the change in the energy source of all ISDIN facilities in the world to a renewable source. This is a medium-term objective that will be completed by a long-term one (Abs2), as ISDIN has already identified that there are facilities in regions that does not have a renewable energy supply or there is no information needed to assess the electrical energy mix and that, therefore, will required long-term strategies. ISDIN's business model, which prioritizes the lease or use of coworking facilities, requires the sharing of this target with the objectives of other companies. For this reason, ISDIN intends to carry out an engagement process in the following years with its installation partners to enable renewable energy contracts.\n",

      "JM is an active member and on the board/the steering committee of the Swedish climate network Haga Initiative.  During 2016 the Haga Initiative decided that the new climate target should be net zero emissions by 2030 for the operations in Sweden, which means that members of the Haga Initiative have set a target to reduce emissions for the Swedish operations by 85%  by 2030, with the base year 2020.  JM has decided to support the target which includes emissions in scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3. JM's previous target was to reduce the absolute emissions in scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 category 6 (business travels) by 40% by 2020 from operations in Sweden, a target that was met (48% reduction). Thus, the current target is set with the base year 2020, and aims to further reduce the emissions that occur due to JM's operations. The target covers JM's company-wide emissions, but there is still an ongoing process to complete the calculations for Finland and Norway. Hence, the emissions related to JM in Finland and Norway are not included in the numbers that are presented for 2021. This will result in updated emission values in the future, but the target of 85% reduction will remain.The use of materials is one of the most important focus areas for JM in terms of reducing climate impact. Concrete represents around 60–75 percent of the total climate impact of the construction process, which is why JM is putting extra effort in this scope 3 category and limiting the emissions related to materials used in construction processes.\n",

Additionally, the company aspires to be net-zero by 2050 in all three scopes.For Scope 3 the focus was put on categories Purchased Goods and Services and Upstream Transportation and Distribution of the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol which are the biggest emission sources of Kautex overall Scope 3 emissions. A value chain hot-spot analysis was implemented to assess the GHG emissions of all upstream categories. The target coverage and exclusion for Scope 3 was derived from the SBTi requirements of a Scope 3 minimum 60% coverage. As purchased goods make up more than 80% of Kautex' upstream Scope 3 emissions, the decision was made to focus strongly on these emissions. The remaining upstream Scope 3 categories apart from transportation emissions were categorized as irrelevant with smaller shares than 5% of the overall assessed company cradle-to-gate carbon footprint and therefore are not covered in the target scope.Downstream emissions are not covered as Kautex is an automotive supplier where use phase emissions, transportation and end-of-life treatment of used products are considered to be within the car manufacturer's scope. However, an analysis was done to estimate the emissions during the use phase of vehicles which showed that Kautex plastic tank and clear vision systems do not cause greenhouse gas emissions as integrated parts in automotive vehicles. End-of-life emissions were considered for Kautex fuel tanks which are currently not regulated by recycling directives. Therefore, the current state shows that most tanks are being incinerated leading to emissions which lay outside Kautex' direct scope of influence.

In the year under review, the target (scope 1+2) was set for the complete company. The need for more transparency in reporting on environmental impacts, which was identified in our context analysis, was met by including it in a project to produce a sustainability report. Specific and measurable targets must be defined also directly at the operational level.We consider the operational implementation of measures to improve environmental performance to be effectively anchored in operational practice. The systematic assessment of environmental aspects and the transparency gained from this enables the improvement of environmental performance to be controlled in a targeted manner. The assessment of the environmental impact on noise, air emissions and soil deposition in the vicinity of the plant has been carried out comprehensively. We consider the proactive communication of the results to be comprehensive and effectively implemented.The procedure for reviewing and updating the energy baseline at process level was effectively applied in accordance with the procedure defined in 2018. Reference is made to the monthly energy reporting. The primary energy sources used at the site are gas, electricity and diesel. Secondary energy sources (compressed air, water consumption, nitrogen) are recorded via the primary energy type \"electricity\". The continuous improvement of the energy performance could be partially demonstrated at the process level. However, the system of key figures must be critically questioned with regard to transparency and inclusion of the main influencing factors. Overlapping effects (e.g. due to raw material supply, capacity utilization and product mix) make the evaluation of the energetic performance development enormously difficult. These possible influencing factors and correlations are systematically examined in our energetic evaluation.

This target measures the performance of improving the fuel efficiency of the MSP.This was part of a programme to increase shipping efficiencies. Kenmare needed to increase shipping capacity to cater for its increase in products from 2021, however without adding new assets. Kenmare has two transhipment barges that moves around 4,000t of products per day from the stocks shed to the client vessels 10km from the shore. This is required due to sea depths. The target covers the diesel consumed to do that transport, from loading at the jetty to offloading at the vessels. It should exclude additional diesel required in the events of tropical storms/cyclones when the barges travel 50km to a protected river mouth.Kenmare Mines use two different methods: 1. Dredging operations (x3), using (low carbon) electrical power) and 2. Dry Mines (x3), using diesel powered front-end-loaders. This target is to replace 1 dry mine by the end of 2022. Assuming the switch is successful, we will transition the two remaining dry mines. Some auxiliary equipment will still be diesel run (excavators).Target focused on overall Scope 1 emissions relative to tonnes of finished product produced. Mechanisms to reduce emissions included energy efficiency initiatives at the Mineral Separation Plant, shipping efficiencies and increased use of renewable energy.\n",

EEOI (Energy Efficiency Operational Index) is defined by IMO and represents CO2 emitted per transported cargo per nautical mile for a period of time (both fuel consumption at sea and in port included). Prior to 2020, end date of a voyage is decisive for which period EEOI for a voyage is included. From 2020 and onwards, reporting system provider was changed so that we are able to calculate EEOI on a per day basis, allocated to the corresponding quarter.The EEOI metric states the strong energy efficiency for KCC's combination carriers as the vessels have substantially lower ballast (sailing empty) than standard vessels. However, as the fleet is relatively small, the reported EEOI is sensitive to periods of non-optimal trading, e.g. when trading a vessel as a standard vessel with ballast in line with standard vessels or when positioning one or more vessels to docking leading to longer ballast voyages. These variations are evident in historic numbers but will most likely become more stable as the CLEANBU newbuilding program was completed in 2021.KCC's target is for carbon intensity (EEOI) to improve by 40%  compared to its actual 2018 performance in 2030.

We have considered 3 perspectives in order to set aspirational but also achievable emission targets: (1) Policy perspective: This is related to aspirations set by and between governments (e.g., Paris agreement, U Green Deal, Greek National Energy Plan).  EU and Greek policy makers target an emission reduction of ~50% by 2030 and carbon neutrality (-100% of emission) by 2050 (compared to 2019 levels). .  (2) Industry leaders perspective: This is related to what leading companies in sustainability are doing and aspiring. Best in class competitors typically target >50% decarbonization by 2030, and full decarbonization by 2050. (3) Mytilineos perspective: This is related to Mytilineos own unique starting position, performance, strategy and business plans. Given the different nature of our activities, we have taken into account the specificities of each business unit. For each of the BUs, we consider their current and expected baseline, characteristics of their business and  changes in the system they operate in.The target is considered science based because it complies with the requirements of Well-below 2°C aligned scenario as described in Science-Based Targets Initiative Tool.  MYTILINEOS has already submitted  the above-mentioned target  for validation by SBTi.The specific target is referring to MYTILINEOS Metallurgy Business Unit  and is part of our wider carbon neutrality goal.  The base year of the target is the financial year 2019. Traditional Metallurgy is a carbon-intense activity. Although our primary aluminium production is practically a fully electrified process, already achieving massive emission reductions above 60% compared to historical levels, and a front-runner in the path of the EU industry towards climate neutrality, our Metallurgy business is determined to maximize its positive contribution to the EU and global effort against climate change. We expect the industry in Europe to decarbonize as the EU seeks to more than halve its emissions over the next decade. At the same time, our customers are increasingly demanding low-carbon aluminium and our competitors have set targets to reduce emissions. To reduce our absolute emissions, we have the following emission reduction levers: 1)  We accelerate the energy transition by sourcing 100% of our energy from RES. 2) We apply state of the art initiatives such as the digitization of our smelters, and investigate new technologies that have the potential todecline direct smelting emissions by 100% and 3) We  grow our secondary aluminium production reaching 50-75ktons of production.The target is considered science based because it complies with the requirements of Well-below 2°C aligned scenario as described in Science-Based Targets Initiative Tool and in 2021.  MYTILINEOS has already submitted  the above-mentioned target as supporting  initiative  of the overall target Abs1 of -30%, for validation by SBTi.\n",

Although our primary aluminium production is practically a fully electrified process, already achieving massive emission reductions above 60% compared to historical levels, and a front-runner in the path of the EU industry towards climate neutrality, our Metallurgy business is determined to maximize its positive contribution to the EU and global effort against climate change. Over the last few years, we have taken three important steps in this direction, coupled by a variety of significant operational improvements and investment to reduce emissions: First, we have improved our energy efficiency by investing in a high-efficiency combined heat and power (‘CHP') facility and moving away from carbon intensive fuels in the industrial processes, drastically cutting CO2 related emissions by an incredible 40%. Spearheading sector developments, we have also promoted the use of advanced analytics, fully digitalizing our smelter, to maximize efficiency. Second, through our new calcination unit we have achieved energy savings above 12% and slashed CO2 emissions by 11%. Thirdly, we have acquired a secondary aluminium facility (EPALME) and significantly boosted remelting, through increased scrap intake. Recycled and recovered aluminium processing has a large emissions advantage over primary aluminium production, using only 5% of the energy needed in primary.  The target is considered science based because it complies with the requirements of Well-below 2°C aligned scenario as described in Science-Based Targets Initiative Tool and in 2021. MYTILINEOS has already submitted  the above-mentioned target as supporting  initiative  of the overall target Abs1 of -30%, for validation by SBTi.Mytilineos is a frontrunner in the effort to decarbonize the Greek electricity mix by replacing highly polluting lignite based electricity generation with renewables and low carbon natural gas.We are already building a state of the art CCGT, achieving an 80% CO2 emission reduction per MWh produced compared to the Greek lignite fleet, and materializing an ambitious RES deployment plan. Mytilineos is leading the national strive, which will call for >9 GW of additional renewable capacity and >1.5GW of gas based capacity by 2030, according to the Greek National Energy & Climate Plan. The target of our national energy plan is to reduce emissions in the Greek power sector by >70%, from ~22.6 MT of CO2 in 2020 to ~6.6 MT by 2030. The remaining ~6.6 MT of emissions will primarily (>90%) come from the remaining CCGTs that enable the uptake of renewables and provide security to the system. Therefore, we have a target to cap our absolute emissions growth to a maximum of 30% although we double our capacity of CCGTs by 2030 based on market conditions & new technologies . In relative terms, we seek to significantly reduce our footprint approximately by 50 % per MWh generated versus 2019.\n",

We plan to continue with these  changing improvements in our plants. In the same way, electricity consumption is reduced since the Dacsa Group Origination team works to obtain the corn with the best efficiencies, since the higher the efficiency of the corn, the less raw material we will mill and, with it, the energy consumption is reduced.

Abs1 covers GHG emissions from all Midsona's operations (scopes 1 and 2) is currently consistent with the reductions required to keep global warming to well-below 2°C.In line with the new Net-zero standard launched by the SBTi at the end of last year, Midsona has committed to re-validate our near-term target to be in line with the more ambitious 1.5-degree targets, as well as committed to reaching a net-zero target by 2045. Reaching zero emissions by 2045 at the latest is a significant milestone for Midsona. The work is now continuing to evaluate the measures that are necessary to accelerate the reduction of Midsona's climate impact.In the second half of 2020, Midsona committed to set ambitious and science-based emission reduction targets according to SBTi. Midsona submitted and got approval for a target in line with SBTi's Criteria v4.2.The SBTi encourages companies to develop scope 3 inventories, and Midsona has completed a scope 3 inventory of all relevant categories based on GHG protocol. This means a high-level evaluation to estimate the scope 3 emissions categories that are relevant to your company and indicate which ones are expected to be most significant. Midsona`s GHG emissions inventory covers all relevant GHG emissions, from all relevant sources and subsidiaries. The GHG inventory is composed exclusively of fossil based emissions, and no biogenic emissions have been reported alongside the GHG inventory. Seven of the Scope 3 categories are relevant to Midsona, and we have measured emissions from all seven categories. Midsona's value chain (scope 3) emissions reduction target meet the SBTi's criteria for ambitious value chain goals, meaning they are in line with current best practice. Midsona's emission mapping and emission targets are in line with the long-term goal of reaching zero emissions by 2045 at the latest and is a significant milestone for Midsona.

      "Emissions inceased in 2021. There are two main reasons for this. The most important one is the significant increase in activities in 2021, with both a strong increase in production volumes from the wood processing business and a strong increase in delivery volumes. The wood processing business is also the most energy-intensive part of the Group and thus the part that is responsible for the greatest emissions. Combined with the fast and strong increase in activity, the Covid-19 pandemic has created certain constraints with regard to implementing planned measures to reduce emissions. An important change will apply to the goal of a reduction in electricity consumption, because many measures to reduce CO2 emissions will lead to an increased use of electric and more environmentally friendly energy. The focus on continuous reduction in electricity consumption per produced unit will however remain in place.GEVA (Greenhouse gas Emissions per Value Added) is an expression for the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and value added. Calculations have been made that show an annual reduction of 5 per cent is required in order for it to be possible to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement. Moelven has tied its sustainability strategy to the Paris Agreement, and is thus committed to working for such a reduction. The long-term goal to reduce the carbon footprint in relation to value creation by 5 per cent annually has been continued, and by 2021 the so-called GEVA factor was reduced by 28.2 per cent. The reason is that value creation was high. The use of bioenergy instead of fossil energy is an important contribution to reducing the direct CO2 emissions from the industrial activities. Emission from the use of heating oil are however now reduced from 6,151 tons in the peak year of 2018, when consumption was extraordinarily high due to a fire in the bioenergy plant at Moelven Valåsen AB, to 881 tons in 2021.The potential for further reductions are mainly linked to the electrification of heavier, diesel powered rolling stock.\n",

      "The 3Di (3-Dimensional inefficiency) metric is a proxy measure for airline fuel burn and emissions efficiency (Scope 3 Category 11 GHG emissions) based on the actual flight trajectory used by airlines. It captures the overall efficiency of UK domestic airspace. 3Di encourages NATS to reduce airline fuel burn and emissions by improving aircraft trajectories across the UK. It does this by computing an efficiency score for every commercial aircraft, which across the year are averaged and compared to targets set by the CAA as part of the regulatory determination. Financial penalties or bonuses apply, depending on how we perform against targets which become more stretching year-on-year.Our 3Di  targets commits us to reduce the inefficiency of flights handled through the airspace it manages by 3.9% per flight by 2022 (calendar year) from a 2019 (calendar year) base year.The biggest improvements to our 3Di score can be delivered by changes to the design the of UK airspace network (motorways in the sky), the implementation of air traffic controller tools (helping stream traffic efficiently) and by improving access to airspace shared with military and other users. But the way our air traffic controllers direct aircraft day-to-day also has an impact.The challenge for our controllers is being able to direct air traffic in a way which has a positive impact on 3Di and simultaneously dealing with a high volume of flights in our network, limited runway capacity which leads to aircraft holding, and occasionally bad weather. We also recognise that the 3Di score is also influenced by variables and factors outside of our control, including the actions of our airline customers, airports, neighbouring air traffic organisations, the military and other airspace users. By taking this inclusive approach the 3Di score encourages NATS to take action where we have direct control and to use our influence to engage customers and stakeholders to affect UK efficiency as a whole. Our regulated business plan, which operates on a 5 year rolling a basis, sets out our planned improvements to airspace and technology, alongside performance expectations in terms of 3Di and reduced emissions as a result of capital investments.  Current performance is attributed to a large degree by the current low UK air traffic levels resulting from the pandemic.\n",

Fossil Free Sweden was initiated by the Swedish government ahead of Paris 2015 as part of the UN Action Agenda. One of the targets in the Roadmap is 50% reduction in absolute scope 1+2+3 emissions (except the use-phase where the industry has little influence). The use phase stands for 31% of NCCs scope 3 as calculated and presented in C6.5. Therefore the % emissions in scope are 69% (100-31=69%). Base year emissions estimated to 7800 000 ton CO2e in total (scope 1+2 2015 = 312 000 ton CO2e and scope 3 is estimated to be 96% of total scope 1+2+3). The target is currently only set for the Swedish operations, corresponding to 62% of NCCs turnover. 62% of 7800000ton CO2e =4836 000 ton CO2e. 69% of 4836 000= 3337 000 ton CO2e. Covered emissions in reporting year are scope 1+2+3 (except the use-phase) for the Swedish operations. Baseline emissions have been recalculated due to increased accuracy. As a lot of our scope 3 emissions are estimated at this point, the result of the calculations above shows the effect of a slightly lower production volume during 2020.

      "In the previous CDP reporting year,  the CO2 emissions performance was measured using one absolute and two intensity figures.  For the current reporting year it was decided that we focus on intensity rather on absolute emissions to avoid problems of comparability over the years.  Absolute figures cannot accurately reflect emissions performance over a period of time. Adding more vessels to current fleet automatically adds to our emissions balance sheet without meaning that our performance deteriorated.  Additionally in 2021 there was a change in the regulatory regime for the intensity method to be used for the CO2 emissions calculation.  The attained annual operational Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) for ro-ro vehicle carriers which is calculated as the ratio of the total mass of CO2 emitted to the total transport work (transport work equals with gross tonnage X distance travelled ) undertaken in a given calendar year, was accepted as the sole method of CO2 emissions calculations on ro ro cargo vessels.  Therefore new calculations had to be made for the  whole fleet using the method described above.  It is reminded that fuel emissions for shipping accounts only for Tank To Wake (TTW). As per SBTi draft Maritime Guidance Document , the IMO emission factors only account for the TTW phase of the fuels' life cycles, because the IMO emission factors do not account for the WTT phase of the fuel life cycles, so they cannot be used to calculate WTW emissions without additional WTT data. CO2 intensity data includes also our chartered tonnage.\n",

NH became the first Spanish hotel company to establish emission reduction targets validated by the SBTi.This target marks out NH HG's roadmap towards a significant reduction in the carbon footprint of its activity in the coming years, aligned with the goal set out in the Paris Agreement to limit the increase in global temperature to less than 2ºC, and join the efforts being made globally towards the transition to a low-carbon economy.To achieve our carbon climate commitment, we are working along 5 lines:•Control and monitoring – the level on which work is being done to improve data capture and analysis, both from the activities of the hotels and of their suppliers, and seek an alignment of commitments to reduce emissions in the value chain.•Energy efficiency – considers all actions that can improve efficiency in the hotel's energy consumption.•Green energy considering both the installation of renewable energy for own consumption and the purchase of green electricity.•Emission offset strategy, with a twofold objective. On one hand, offsetting as an exceptional alternative to comply with the annual targets set and, on the other hand to give visibility to the Company's climate commitment by involving guests in it.•Carbon analysis in development projects to anticipate the needs of adaptation of new properties to the climate goal so that it is not compromised.In September 2019, NH Hotel Group approved and announced that it will reduce its carbon emissions by 20% by 2030 (avoiding the emission of more than 70,000 metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere). With it the Company became the first Spanish hotel company to establish emission reduction targets that have been scientifically validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).NH Hotel Group has undergone an analysis of its emissions, which has allowed them to know that the Category Purchase of Goods and Services of Scope 3 is the one that generates the most volume of emissions, that is why it is in this category where the most actions are wanted to be carried out.

Achieving these goals involves, among many other measures:- An exhaustive analysis of the opportunities to continue working with suppliers and together reduce the carbon footprint. In 2019, 2020 and 2021, the suppliers with the largest carbon footprint have been identified and we are working with them to improve reporting channels and to seek alignment to reduce emissions in the value chain.- Continuing to contract green energy and reinforcing energy efficiency in the hotels.

      "The target set was seeking to improve our direct environmental impact and decouple our company's growth from impact by expanding our corporate sustainability strategy and finding new ways to reduce our direct carbon impact. We did not seek to reduce this by a percentage but rather address this in absolute terms on a location basis. The aim is to reduce, neutralise and eventually eliminate our Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions and reduce Scope 3 wherever possible. The target covers all of Ninety One's scope 1 &2 emissions except for a few de-minimum sites for which data cannot be obtained. These sites are outlined in C6.4a and contribute a very minor proportion to Ninety One's total activities. Scope 3 emissions include Category 5 and 6 given these categories could be measured and verified by Carbon Trust. We have not verified 1.5C alignment but have used Science-based methodology to measure and report on target progress.We have worked with the Carbon Trust to develop targets for reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions, andhave set a near-term target using a methodology aligned with the SBTi, as follows:We aim to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 (location based) GHG emissions by 46% by 2030 from a 2019base year. This would mean an absolute decrease from 3,773 tonnes to 2,030 tonnes The SBTi guidelines permit the use of market- or location-based carbon accounting to set and track progress towards Scope 2 targets. We have opted to use location-based carbon-accounting. This is the most ambitious approach because location-based targets are largely determined by the emissions intensity of the local grid – which inSouthern Africa, where we have sizeable operations, is heavily reliant on fossil fuels for power generation. South Africa's grid depends on coal power electricity for 90% of generation capacity, making it 10x morecarbon emitting than France.\n",

Base year GHG emissions will be recalculated with any significant change in business operations (for example, acquisitions or divestments, or a change in product portfolio), corrections to historical data based on availability of more accurate information, or changes to reporting methodology. We calculate our GHG intensity based on the following boundaries: • EMISSIONS BOUNDARIES Gross Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions, stated in carbon dioxide equivalent terms, calculated using the EU ETS methodology. This means that the CO2 used in the production of urea and other downstream processes, which is defined as Scope 3 as per the GHG Protocol and part of scope 3 in the table above, is included. By including the CO2 that goes into downstream processes, we eliminate the fluctuations that may occur when we make any changes or experience downtime in our downstream product mix and present a transparent view of the CO2 produced when making ammonia. This also better aligns us to the SBTi's methodology. • PRODUCTION BOUNDARIES Gross ammonia production on a nutrient-ton basis, and our total methanol production on a product ton basis. We believe this most accurate reflects the nitrogen content of our production portfolio, eliminates the possibility of double counting downstream products and normalizes for annual fluctuations in our product mix.\n",

Developing access to competitive and low-carbon electricity for all in a world fighting against global warming The IPCC scenarios confirm it: to contain global warming to 1.5° C and continue to evolve in a sustainable world, nuclear power is not the only solution, but it is essential. The Paris Agreement on the fight against climate change provides for a sharp reduction in CO2 emissions and the European Union has set itself a target of carbon neutrality by 2050. Orano intends to contribute to this collective mobilization.  In addition to being convinced of the role that nuclear power can play in the energy transition towards low-carbon electricity, Orano has been involved in a program to reduce its own emissions since 2004 in order to contribute to the collective effort. The group made a commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50% between 2004 and 2020. Based on these results, Orano wants to go further in its contribution to carbon neutrality with a new target to reduce its direct and indirect GHG emissions (scopes 1 and 2) by 15% by 2025 compared to 2019 (thus 2,5% reduction per year, aligned to the French National Low Carbon Strategy - SNBC for French Strategie Nationale Bas Carbone, which is aligned on the below 2° Paris Agreement).\n",

For instance, certain product grades by virtue of their properties tend to have higher yield than others, leading to lower CO2 intensity. Coal-based feedstocks also tend to have higher yield than petroleum-based feedstocks. Our normalization process is designed to remove the CO2 intensity resulting from product grade and feedstock mix variances. In 2020, we increased the reduction target from 5% to 8% against the 2014 base. The inclusion of decarbonization in our corporate strategy recognizes the importance of positioning Orion for a low-carbon economy. We recognize the importance of having GHG emissions reduction targets aligned with a low-carbon scenario and having credible plans to achieve them. We have conducted a preliminary life cycle assessment to understand our broader carbon footprint.

(EPS is renamed as Asset Solutions (AS) in 2021)A seperate target has been set for E&C+EPS business division.  Purpose of defining two emission reduction targets is to have a ease in monitoring the status of targets and impacts of the emission reduction projects/  strategies and peer comparison.  Targets for all the business divisions covers 100%  emission of Petrofac group. IES division deploys traditional equity upstream investment model i.e. Production Sharing Contracts (PSC)   in upstream oil and gas industry. IES contributes to 75-85% of the Petrofac Group absolute carbon emissions due to natural gas and diesel consumption for power generation, flaring and venting at offshore installation PM 304 in Malaysia. We aim to achieve a 2% year-on-year reduction in GHG intensity over baseline year of 2020, with a 20% reduction by 2030 in IES. The intensity metric is,  t CO2e per  BOE produced.Until year 2020 Petrofac has equity share in PM304- Malaysia,  and Santuario (Mexico.) By end of 2020 Petrofac fully divested from Mexico asset. As of now Petrofac has equity share only in PM 304 Malaysia .In 2021, IES absolute emissions were 164,044 tCO2e (223,822 tCO2e in 2020). i.e. 27%  decrease from previous year. In the reporting year a well management campaign was commenced at PM304 asset to reduce the generation of associated gas from the producing well. This project  resulted in the overall flaring reduction, since excess associated gas is flared at the asset. During the well management campaign the production too was disrupted and this resulted in lower fuel consumption, less flaring and less production, compared to the previous year 22% decrease  in flaring emission( i.e 116,937 tCO2e flaring emission in 2021 and 149,331 tCO2e in 2020) .Net  production for the year 2021 from our equity interests decreased  by 66 % to 0.640 million barrels of oil equivalent (mboe) (2020: 1.9 mboe) reflecting prior year asset sales and lower production at PM304 Malaysia. Being denominator, decrease in production figures has negatively impacted the emission intensity inspite of 27% decrease in absolute emissions. .This particular target is set for the business division EPS+E&C combined. E&C and EPS divisions includes project construction and duty holder services for the oil & gas and energy customers. These two business divisions contribute to more than 90% of the Petrofac revenues and around 15- 25% of the absolute emissions. The onshore and offshore EPC projects, duty holder service contracts for oil and gas assets, training offices and design engineering offices fall under these two business divisions. We aim to achieve a 2% year-on-year reduction in greenhouse gas emission intensity over the baseline year of 2020, with a 20% reduction by 2030 in these business divisions. The intensity metric is Thousand metric ton CO2e per million manhours worked.Thus both the targets Int1 and Int2 covers the 100% carbon emission of the Petrofac groupIn 2021 the absolute emissions  for E&C+EPS were 33,178 tCO2e(36,417 tonnes CO2e in 2020) a reduction of 9%  from previous year. There was an increase of 6091 tCO2e this year due to acquisition of W&W energy services in USA.

Direct (Scope 1) CO2 emissions from combustion of biofuels and/or biomass feedstocks equaled 61 tCO2e in 2021. This calculation is linked to the scope 1 mobile emissions back calculation, reducing fossil emissions from mobile transport. The reduction in fossil emissions from using the biofuel blend instead of the 100% mineral EF doesn't translate into a like for like increase in biofuel emissions. E.g., 1tCO2 of saved fossil emissions doesn't equal 1tCO2 of biogenic emissions. The combined diesel and petrol biogenic EF are calculated as a percentage of fossil CO2 saved.  For Ramboll UK, it was calculated based on DEFRA fuel factors.The Greenhouse gases (GHG) excluded from Ramboll's inventory, and therefore, from the target's coverage are: HFC, PFC, SF6 and NF3. These GHGs are not relevant for Ramboll operations as they are mainly associated with industrial processes. HFCs are considered non-material/below threshold for Ramboll operations. Emissions from HFCs are mainly tied to Ramboll's air conditioning systems in vehicles and buildings. A number of the organization's buildings do not have HVAC systems. HFCs are likely to be non-material, but Ramboll will work to ensure more consistent data collection for future inventories.  There are some facilities excluded: a limited number of smaller offices are dynamic in nature (project offices, co-workspaces etc.) and can change status throughout the year (occupied/vacated). Obtaining valid data for these locations is not possible. Consequently, any office with a headcount under five is not accounted for.

For the year 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021, and differing from previous reporting years (but not 2020) sales volumes have been based on sales actuals for Q4-Q3 due to timelines required for inclusion in the Annual Report. Shifting the 12 month period we report on eliminates the need to use financial forecast data.The carbon footprint associated with the indirect-use consumer phase isn't included in our product carbon footprint/Scope 3 target. This approach is in line with the WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Protocol and helps us focus on things in our control. We know we can't ignore that indirect-use phase carbon emissions directly as we do not control the nature of energy used by consumers at home. However, to help achieve reductions in this area, we're designing our products so that when they are used they use less energy or water, for example by enabling consumers to lower the temperature on their washing machine. This means less energy is needed to power appliances at home, lowering their carbon footprint and helping combat climate change.As part of launching our new sustainability ambitions in 2021, we've updated our modelling, to fully include all of our business and reflect the timelines of our science-based targets from 2015 to 2030. The modifications include: 1. Changing our baseline from 2012 to 2015 2. Including all our Infant Formula and Child Nutrition (IFCN) business in our target, acquired from Mead Johnson3. Adjusting for the 2021 divestment of Scholl and our IFCN business in China to reflect the current corporate entity. However, the main change to our modelling is the move from a measure of carbon intensity – carbon footprint per dose of product – to a measure of absolute carbon emissions compared to the 2015 baseline.We have also set an ambitious 2040 net zero target, to reduce our absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by 100% by 2040 versus 2015.

The intensity factor is £million revenue at constant exchange rates - CER (to avoid fluctuations caused by foreign exchange variations and the impact of acquisitions). Scope 1 and 2 emissions cover all the Company's global property energy and vehicle fuel consumption.

      "In response to the demands of its stakeholders of tracking the absolute emissions, in 2021 Repsol released Abs 1 target which covers the Scope 1+2 emissions from operated assets at Company level and it implies the reduction of these emissions by 55% in 2030 compared to 2016. This target allows to monitor the operational efficiency, which is the basis for the decarbonization of scope 1 and 2 emissions, opportunities management in technology and design related to our own operations that bring an emission reduction.In response to the demands of its stakeholders of tracking the absolute emissions in order to ensure that the carbon intensity (gCO2e/MJ) not only decreases because of the increase of production (denominator) but the emissions reduction too (numerator), Repsol has set the Abs2 which corresponds to the numerator of the CII and has to be reduced 30% by 2030 in comparison to 2016. It considers the direct and indirect emissions (scope 1 and 2) from E&P (operated assets), Refining and Chemical industrial sites in Spain, Portugal and Peru and Low Carbon Generation sites world-wide businesses. The rest of the businesses and areas of the company have not been included because they are not material (< 1% of the total scope 1 and 2).Scope 3 included in the target corresponds to the emissions associated with the use of our products from our oil and gas production (Cat.11), and the ones from third-party hydrogen plants that supply our industrial facilities (Cat.1). Besides, avoided emissions from our low-carbon power generation assets are included because they replace the marginal power mix in the country where they are located (this will reduce over time, as the electricity mix of each country progressively decarbonizes) and if levers such as Carbon Capture, Use and Storage (CCUS) or Natural Climate Solutions (NCS) are implemented are also considered. In the base year, Scope 3 Cat.11 associated to the Upstream production was approximately the 50% of Scope 3 Cat.11 calculated in relation to the refinery sales.This target refers to our Routine Flaring target, with 2 different time horizons, 2025 as reported in Abs 3 and 2030 as reported in Abs4. The aim is to minimize routine flaring as soon as possible and by no later than 2030 at Upstream operated facilities, so it covers Scope 1 emissions from this business unit and no exclusions have been made.This target refers to our Routine Flaring target, with 2 different time horizons, 2025 as reported in Abs 3 and 2030 as reported in Abs4.

      "In 2018 an extra company has been acquired. Also because of this the amount of waste has gone up significantly. Because no data about the amount of waste generated before 2018 from this company, we have revised this target with base year in 2018.The company has grown with 17.12% in volume sold (2021 vs 2018), where the CO2(e) of waste has grown 12,13% in the same period. The aim is to reduce the amount of waste that goes into incineration. The biggest increase can be seen in 2019.  The reasons we see is that also in the non-digital productions the order volumes decreased, which resulted in a lot more set-up waste than anticipated.We consider this as a science-based target based on the data that has been submitted to the science based initiative. The request has been sent  to the science based imitative via the letter: 'Science based Targets Call to Action Target Setting Letter for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises' which has been signed on 29/06/2020.   The covered emissions in base year  has been changed in 2021 because for the Spanish site no location based scope 2 was used in 2018. The group had a >17% growth in sold volume 2021 vs 2018. Scope 1 and scope 2 emissions have decreased with 1,4%  which is for the first time. One of the reasons for this is because the investments in the solar panels that show in the data since 2021 was the first full year of use.Another part is that the location based conversion factors have gone down. This means that the electricity from the grid is also been generated more from  more sustainable sources.Our company organically grows about 2,5-5% every year. We foresee that in the near future also the energy consumption will increase. We have noticed that the electricity that we buy from the grid is getting more generated from sustainable sources and therefore the conversion factors are decreasing . This will potentially have a positive impact on achieving this objective. By installing solar panels and locally generated electricity from renewable sources, we want to reduce the amount of electricity bought from the grid and by this further decrease the absolute CO2(e) scope 2 emissions.With the electrification of the company fleet in the coming years we foresee that the scope 1 CO2(e) emissions will go down with 2-4% due to this.\n",
      "Since we mostly base ourselves on the amount of m² sold, taking the intensity target against the m² is a way of following our efficiency, including scope 1 emissions. The base year is set at 2018 as that is the year we have bought our Spanish sites, making the total scope 1 and 2 emissions higher than the years before 2018.This is our first long term CO2(e) objective. Since we aim to grow at least 2,5-5% every year, a decrease in relative CO2(e) emissions of 5% is seen as a good target. If in the following years we see the target of 5% is to low, we will adjust it to a higher level, which we did in this revision where we set the goal at 15% reduction instead of 5%. The target year is being set as 2025 coming from 2033 as it gives a good focus on the science based target of 2030.In the reporting year our result is 0.000300033 CO2(e)/m².  In the base year this was 0.000365511.This means in 2020 we are  >15% lower than in the base year, which makes that we achieved our target.  The target will be reset to 25% from 2021 on.  This  data includes our Spanish site where the site was not included in the base year.  Since this is a Int. target, we don't see this as an issue. The impact of the adjusted scope 2 location based conversion factors had a positive impact on the result. Because the target was reset from 15 to 25% the target has not been reached.In the reporting year the result was 0.000199866 where it was in the base year 0.000239654, this means a decrease of >16% where the target was 5%.  In the reporting year also the new acquired company in Spain was included where it was not in the base year.  As the target year is 2022 it has to be proven that this good result can be continued.

      "In 2019, we looked at our operations in detail to explore emission reduction opportunities for each asset and developed corresponding marginal abatement cost curves. This comprehensive work informed our 2030 targets which are to reduce our emissions intensity by 30% and our absolute emissions by 15%, measured against a baseline of 2018. These targets were updated on 20 October 2021. Our new targets are to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 15% by 2025 and by 50% by 2030.We use the equity share approach for consolidating our total Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, to which we apply the benefit of our use of valid offsets. This approach applies to both absolute and intensity calculations, where our equity share of production from managed and non-managed operations is used when determining our GHG emissions intensity. In order to account for the different commodities across our business, our production is calculated on a copper equivalent basis.\" In specific circumstances we may apply appropriate adjustments to the 2018 baseline data. Acquisitions and divestments will result in a commensurate adjustment to the baseline to include (acquisition) or exclude (divestment) the relevant operation from the baseline. Permanent closure of assets will not result in any adjustment to the baseline. Similarly, we will not adjust the baseline if our global production increases from the expansion of existing operations or new projects, such as Winu in Australia. These growth projects are expected to be developed in a manner that enables us to deliver against our absolute and intensity targets. The 2018 emissions was restated since the figures of 31.8 Mt CO2e were published in our 2019 Climate change report as a result of the following events:- Rio Tinto Marine restated their 2018 Scope 1 emissions following a review of their Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions.- Escondida restated their Scope 2 emissions as a result of a change from the location approach to estimating Scope 2 emissions to the market approach.- In 2020 various non-managed assets provided clearer details of their 2018 emissions, resulting in a net gain in Rio Tinto's equity emissions for 2018, which has replaced emission estimates used previously by Rio Tinto.- Our equity interest in ERA increased in 2020 from 68.39% to 86.33%.-  In 2021, our equity share in the Diavik mine increased to 100%.\"\n",

In 2020, we included our new industrial acquisition, Sirius.Robertet didn't improve its GHG emissions  reductions between 2017 and 2020 for several reasons:-CSR department, created in January 2020 analysed the 2017 and 2018 consolidated data and found significant errors in previous calculations. It turns out that 2017 and 2018 data  were  under estimated. That's why the 2017 baseline has evolved but it was not possible to recalculate all the 2017 data. To overcome this problem, the CSR department is implementing a new CSR strategy, with new targets on GHG emissions reduction, based on 2020 data. These targets will be implemented for this reporting 2021 year.- A new reporting tool was implemented in 2020, and the calculation ofGHG emissions has been deepened. Emissions related to refrigerant leaks, as well as emissions related to vehicle consumption have been added in 2020. It was not possible to add back these emissions from previous years (2019, 2018 and 2017). All sources of GHG have been taken into account in 2020 on scopes 1 and 2, which automatically increases the Group's GHG emissions in 2020 compared to previous years.-The Robertet Group is in the process of modernizing its factories in order, amongst other things, to improve the working environment of employees.

      "In 2017, SAP set the target to achieve a net-zero carbon footprint of SAP's operations by 2025. However, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced a significant decrease in our 2020 and 2021 carbon emissions due to a reduction in carbon-intensive business activities, in particular, business flights. Even though our employee headcount increased by 2.8%, our carbon emissions dropped to 110 kilotons (kt) (2020: 135 kt). To consider this impact, to uphold our role model position in sustainability, and to maintain our ambition level, we now aim to become carbon neutral in our own operations by 2023 – two years earlier than what we aimed for thus far. Our carbon neutral target includes all direct (scope 1), indirect (scope 2) and selected categories of value chain (scope 3) GHG emissions such as business flights, employee commuting, paper consumption, and co-locations of data centers. SAP will continue existing initiatives and programs to drive efficiency and innovation to avoid and reduce GHG emissions, following our approach ''avoid – reduce – compensate”.  Part of SAP's carbon neutral strategy is the investment into climate protection projects based on high-quality carbon offset purchases.SAP has committed to set 1.5°C science-based emissions reduction targets aligned with a net-zero future, responding to what the latest climate science indicates is needed to limit the worst impacts of climate change.  Since 2017, we have complied with the requirements of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and are committed to reducing emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) by 85% by 2050 compared to the base-year level 2016, including emissions of our products in use at our customers. This target reflects the level of decarbonization required to keep the global temperature increase below 1.5°C compared to preindustrial temperatures. This has been confirmed by the SBTi in a target reassessment in 2019. SAP is one of seven global companies that already had 1.5°C-aligned reduction targets, and the first one in Germany. Please see press release by UNGC and SBTi: https://sciencebasedtargets.org/2019/07/23/9334/To consider the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our CO2e emissions & to uphold our own ambition level, in 2021 SAP committed to achieve net-zero along our entire value chain in line with a 1.5°C future in 2030 – 20 years earlier than originally targeted.

The Salzgitter Group operates an integrated steel site in Salzgitter, accounting for roughly 95 % of the group-wide Scope 1 CO2 emissions. Recently the steel production at this site is done via the conventional and worldwide established so called blast furnace / blast oxygen furnace route. Unavoidably on this carbon-based production route, around 1.5 tons of CO2 per ton of crude steel (without emissions e.g. from ore preparation and coke making) occur during the reduction process. This limit has been more or less reached by the steel production in Salzgitter as well as by many other steel sites in Europe. Due to this, Salzgitter Group is investigating an opportunity to produce steel using mainly green hydrogen instead of carbon, leading to far lower CO2 emissions. This would be an approach of carbon direct avoidance (CDA) which differs from other approaches like carbon capture and storage (CCS) or carbon capture and usage (CCU). But such approaches are less energy efficient than SALCOS®. Our project has reached a high publicity in the European politics in the last years.

The project aimed to identify different scenarios to be aligned with the Paris agreement 1.5 degrees.Schibsted has based its scenario analysis on data and information gathered from 13 interviews conducted with significant stakeholders as well as data gathered from our Norwegian distribution network. Data that has been gathered and used is: the length of distribution route; number of products delivered; number of routes completed per year; mode of transportation (driving, walking, etc.); car type and fuel type; age of the vehicle; employee or self-employed person; and, type of route (city centre, country road, countryside). Based on the collected data and information Schibsted has used the RCP 1.9 model as well as an own developed model.The time horizon is 2019 – 2025, and the targets are aligned with the Science-Based Targets and the Paris Agreement target of 1.5 degrees. The target was chosen based on it being the most relevant for Schibsted's business operations and its alignment with the overall sustainability strategy.

All emissions from assets and facilities over which Sensata has operational control are captured in its GHG emissions inventory. These emission sources include all owned and leased facilities and vehicles. Operational control is defined by The GHG Protocol as whether the Company or one of its subsidiaries possesses the authority to introduce and implement operating policies of the emission-generating activity. Emissions from assets and facilities over which Sensata has no operational control will not be included in its GHG emissions inventory. Defining operational boundaries involves identifying the emissions associated with Sensata's operations and categorizing them as either direct (Scope 1) or indirect (Scope 2).

The CO2 is transported through a 65-kilometre pipeline and injected more than two kilometres underground below multiple layers of impermeable rock formations. It is designed to capture, transport and store over one million tonnes of CO2 annually.

The company's innovative drive combined with sustainability is a key component. Sustainability is the overarching principle with the overall goal to reduce the CO2eq emissions (scope 1 and 2, market-based) per ton sold by 12% until 2023.— The Sustainability Strategy ''More Value – Less Impact” 2023, Sika pursues six strategic target areas, focusing on Climate Performance, Energy, Waste/Water, Community Engagement, Occupational Safety, and Sustainable Solutions.The \"Climate Performance\" KPI - scope 1 and 2 CO2eq emissions  - follows the reporting guidelines of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol – Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard and it covers:- direct CO2 emissions (scope 1) from burning fossil fuels by all Sika companies and by its own vehicles and leased vehicles, and - indirect CO2 emissions  (scope 2) related to electricity consumption.To track the company performance vs. the strategic KPI, \"tons sold\" is the denominator and it includes all Sika manufactured and third-party traded products (finished good materials purchased from third parties for resale). In the past three years,  the quantity of third-party traded tons sold has been stable. Therefore, it did not impact the Group performance.Between 2019-2020, following scope changes (M&A, divestment), the CO2eq intensity indicator has not been restated. In 2021, the fuel consumption of leased vehicles has been included in direct - scope 1 emissions since Sika has operational control as per the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG). The category \"leased vehicles\" was considered under scope 3 until year 2020. Scope 1 emissions from 2019 and 2020 have not been restated accordingly. The scope of Sika Sustainability reporting is aligned with the scope of entities consolidated in the Group financial statements. However, Hamatite and Landun data have been excluded from consolidated 2021 figures related to CO2 intensity to facilitate companies onboarding and ensure proper integration in the Sika sustainability reporting system.\n",

Only paper production is taken into account given its relative fuel use compared to our converting operations (90% and 10% respectively), and hence its contribution to our total fossil CO2 emissions.  The difference in percentages (81% emissions in scope and 90% relative fuel consumption) is due to the fact that our paper mill network is highly self sufficient and has a lower usage of electricity from the grid compared to the converting operations, which are higher in using scope 2 energy.  At our paper mills, when producing our own heat and power, we can reach over 90% efficiency of the fuel energy value compared to the electricity produced to the grid (30-60% efficiency). We have included scopes 1 and 2 in our climate change targets due to the fact that we can influence these ourselves through the choices we make in our energy production and purchase.In case we buy electricity from suppliers who give Full Disclosure on the type of the fuels used for the generation of this electricity, the CO2 emissions of this electricity are based on the CO2 emission factors of these fuels. In case we participate in a electricity generation facility off site (p.a. off shore wind mill) the electricity and corresponding CO2 emission factor of this facility are taken into account in the indirect emissions calculation.

An integral element of the Group's G.R.O.W. strategy, the plan is directly aligned with Solvay's purpose of bonding people, ideas and elements to reinvent progress.The plan outlines ten ambitious targets to drive progress across three key pillars: climate, resources and better life. To meet these goals, Solvay pledges to reallocate investments to promote sustainability within its portfolio, operations and workplace.''With Solvay One Planet, we are setting bolder objectives to solve key environmental and societal challenges through science and innovation,” says CEO Ilham Kadri. ''Beyond climate change, we will tackle resource scarcity and promote a better life. Together with our customers, we will create sustainable shared value for all.  This is Progress Beyond. This is G.R.O.W.”Solvay One Planet is inspired by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It includes ten measurable commitments in three key focus areas, to be achieved by 2030, three of which focusing on Climate-related issues:Climate1.    Lowering greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. On October 28, 2021, Solvay announced its plans to reach carbon neutrality before 2050. The 2030 target for greenhouse gas emissions has been upgraded to reduce by -30% from -26% initially, as compared to the 2018 baseline. 2.    Eliminating the use of coal. Solvay will not build new coal-powered plants and commits to phase out coal usage in energy production wherever renewable alternatives exist.All of Solvay's targets are company wide, with a scope consistent with the way sales are reported.In October 2020, Solvay joined the Science-Based Targets initiative and is currently working to define its objectives for scope 3 emissions. Solvay expects to finalize scope 3 targets and communicate more on these ambitions in 2022. Solvay's scope 3 target shall at least meet the 2C criteria of the Science Based Targets initiative.  The Scope 3 target will need to cover at least emissions related to raw materials, and emissions related to the processing, use and end of life of products.  Climate commitments will become a criteria of choice for future strategic supplier relationships. In April 2021, Solvay launched its first Supplier Engagement Program.Solvay would like to commit to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods and services, fuel and energy related activities, processing, use, and end of life of sold products 24% by 2030 from a 2018 base year. The target focuses on the most relevant Scope 3 categories, mainly raw materials, processing, use and end of life of products (category 3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12). The main five categories of scope 3 emissions are included in the target. Together they make 89% of 2021 scope 3 emissions.  This scope 3 target is under the revision and validation of SBTi. Until their formal validation, this target is not official and binding.For scope 3, impacts of changes in the reporting scope and methodology will start to be audited when the SBTi targets are approved. The base year (2018) emissions data has been retroactively recalculated to reflect significant change in the company structure. In 2021, the sale of fluorine chemicals assets in South Korea has an impact of -2,981,000tCO2 (divestment reported in p.214 and 312 of the 2021 Annual integrated report).

Now the perimeter encompasses 9 locations out of 9 and is thus complete.Due to this change in perimeter, the previous targets are no longer relevant and three new targets were set in 2021.These three targets are the new base for upcoming years in order to compare and track progress.The third target (Abs 11) centers on emissions of Category 9 (Dowstream transportation and distribution) of Scope 3. When combined, the categories 9 and 1 (see second target) represent more than 85% of emissions of Scope 3 and more than 80% of emissions of all scopes combined. In addition, Somater has some leverage to reduce emissions in this category (e.g by changing suppliers contracts). This is thus relevant to have a target on this category with the aim to have it validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi).\n",

The target was set in 2018, with 2018 market based emissions as base year emissions. Scope 1 Temissions include fuel for vehicles, calculated based on petrol and diesel consumption. Scope 2 emissions  include electricity (market based) and district heating (Bergen). Sparebanken Vest has purchased Guarantee of Origin for 100% of its electricity consumption. Scope 3 emissions include business travel by air, milage allowances for travel by car, and waste.  Internal GHG emissions (scope 1 and 2) have been reduced to a minimum since base year 2018. and we met this target already in 2020.  We have managed to cut 75% of our own climate footprint since 2018. A large reduction in footprint was in transport, predominantly due to covid-19 . Our a target was  to reach 100 tCO2e in 2025 . This target can be considered a Science Based Target as it meets the ambition requirement criteria in line with a 1,5 degree target set by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi).  The bank acknowledges that the biggest and most important job going forward is to reduce the bank's indirect  financed emissions (Scope 3) whih are indirectly related to the bank's activiites, and thereby beyond the bank's control.  For the first time, in our annual report for 2021  the bank reported on the bank's financed emissions,  i.e. emissions weighted by LTV ratio per commitment for approx 70%  of the bank's corporate lending book . These are part of our scope 3 emissions. The emissions are calculated based on figures from 2020 and compared with available figures from 2019.Net zero  emissions by  2040 is the bank's long-term overriding target for the business as a whole.  We will reach net zero when the amount we add is no more than the amount of emissions taken away.  Sparebanken VEst has recently submitted an application to the Science BAsed Targets Initiative (SBTi) to ensure that the goal of reducing GHG emissins is aligned with the Paris agreement, where the goal is to keep the global temperature increase below 1.5 degrees Celsius. This is a long-term target currently covering Sparebanken Vest's Scope 1 and 2, and categories Waste and Business Travel in Scope 3. The target was set in 2020, with 2018 market based emissions as base year emissions.  The bank acknowledges that the biggest and most important job going forward is to reduce the bank's indirect emissions (Scope 3- financed emissions, i.e. emissions weighted by LTV ratio per commitment) ) which are indirectly related to the bank's activiites, and thereby beyond the bank's control., and these emmissions shall be be included in the net zero emission target within 2040. Climate is still an area where it is difficult to gain an adequate picture of both risks and opportunities, primarily because of the low availability of reliable consistent data. The bank has made considerable efforts in 2021 to map available data and collect data directly from customers to improve its data basis.  Sparebanken Vest has therefore developed a web portal for annual registration of relevant emission data for both new and existing customers.   The bank has collected data from customers in shipping, offshore, fisheries and small-scale power production, while collection of the property portfolio is still ongoing.  We have gained data for approx 70% of thecorporate lending book.  I.e, our scope 3 emissions is still a project \"underway\" and does not yet show the complete picture of our financed emissions. You  may read more about our scope 3 emissions in, the bank's annual report for  2021. The emissions are calculated based on available figures from 2020 and compared with available figures from 2019Since the reporting of financed emissions data in scope 3 is still rather incomplete, we have chosen not to show /include available data in  figures above.

There is a big improvement in the bank's score and total financed emissions from 2019 to 2020 due to changes in assumptions for the development path in thePoseidon Principles, which affects several of the bank's shipping segments.  This means that tonnes Co2 equivalents calculated from base year are not completely comparable to current reported figures for 2020 . In addition the bank's results for 2019 were negatively affected by a classification error in one of the bank's shipping segment as well.As we are planning  to get all our climate targets validated by SBTi,  this also includes the shipping portfolio target. This means we will revise   our shipping portfolio target before sending it to the SBTi for validation. Shipping accounts roughly for 60%  of the banks's reported emissions for scope 1, 2 and 3 for 2020.   Our  Scope 3 emissions is still a poject underway, and reported figures for 2020  accounts for  roughly 70% of the corporate lending book.

The target was changed for the 2021 business year with the launch of our new sustainability strategy, One Planet: Engineering with Purpose.  Each year the target is reviewed so that individual sites can aim to reduce absolute emission at 3.5 - 4% or more per year, but if investment is not made in year 1, e.g. due to other priorities, it can be delivered in subsequent periods to make the saving over the medium term set.  With the launch of our One Planet strategy and the new targets that have been established, we are restating our previously reported figures for 2019 and 2020. Previous figures included a small number of estimates, due to the availability of billed data at the time of reporting. Our new baseline and restated 2020 figures are based on actual data and improved estimates where billed data is not available and therefore have a higher level of accuracy. In May 2019, we acquired Thermocoax and its subsidiaries. Previously, Thermocoax's energy and carbon emissions were only included in our 2020 data, in line with our reporting methodology, as this was the first full year in the Group for the Business. However, to ensure a representative baseline, we have included a full year of Themocoax's energy use and emissions in our restated 2019 figures.

The emerging standard when setting emissions reduction targets says one should set interim targets consistent with a ''fair share” of the 50% global reduction in CO2 identified as a requirement in the IPCC special report on global warming 1.5°C. Our current greenhouse gas emission intensity are currently about 45– 60% lower than the global economy (depending on the choice of denominator). However, we have a higher exposure towards the Nordics compared to the global economy, a comparably wealthy region which by all accounts has to lead the way in decarbonising the economy. Thus, given our starting point and our regional exposure which demands a steep trajectory of decarbonisation, we believe a 50% reduction from our starting point is a fair share.The base year for the target has been revised due to a substantial change in methodology for scope 3.During 2021 ISS ESG made a large change and improvement to their Scope 3 calculation methodology, which now includes the usage of reporteddata together with enhanced model estimates. The methodology change is significant and provides a much better picture of the companies' actual Scope 3 emissions, but it alsomakes any historical comparisons harder.

We report GHG emissions from our own facilities (Scope 1 direct emissions), emissions from purchased energy used in our own operations (Scope 2 indirect emissions), and emissions in our full value chain according to the Corporate Value Chain Standard (Scope 3) of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.  In the process of setting targets, we have identified a wide range of actions to be taken in pursuit of reducing our value chain emissions. Action plans have been set and responsibilities have been distributed across the Group for main sources of emissions.

This involves adopting a greenhouse gas emission reduction target in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, namely to limit the average global temperature increase over pre-industrial levels to well below two degrees Celsius, and to continue efforts to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.As such, Teleperformance has committed to reducing its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 49% per full-time equivalent employee (FTE) between 2019 and 2026, and to reduce Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services and from employee commuting by 38.3% per FTE between 2019 and 2026. The Group is also assessing the impact of climate change scenarios on its business plans and potential decarbonization pathways. The adoption of Science-Based Targets involves the implementation and ramp-up of decarbonization initiatives in the Company's operations around the world. Thanks to this commitment, Teleperformance is moving towards measures that aim to make it more resilient and better prepared for a carbon-constrained world. The Group has also joined the Climate Pledge, a coalition of over 200 companies committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2040.The Scope 3 emissions reduction target approved by the SBTi only relates to the two highest emissions categories under Scope 3, i.e. purchased goods and services and employee commuting, which together account for over 90% of the Group's Scope 3 emissions. Under the SBTi, Teleperformance has prepared a complete inventory of all of its Scope 1, 2 and 3 emission items, and has recalculated its carbon footprint for the 2019 baseline year. When the 2019 Universal Registration Document was published, the Group was not yet reporting Scope 1 or certain major Scope 3 items. As such, the 2019 carbon footprint has been recalculated in keeping with the GHG Protocol in order to include all scopes and base the Group's carbon footprint reduction targets on a comprehensive 2019 baseline.

The reduction target was then submitted and approved by the SBT Initiative in the first half of the 2021.The target set addresses scope 1 + 2 emissions of Terna S.p.A., and intends to reduce absolute emissions 28% by 2030 from a 2019 base year, and is modelled using the Absolute Contraction approach.Please note that, compared to last year, scope 2 emissions of the base year have been changed due to a recalculation of CO2 emissions related to grid losses.  Terna before had been responsible only for the measurement of energy injected into the NTG and not for the energy withdrawn. Considering the margin of uncertainty in order to reduce  the measurement errors, in previous publications it was decided to use the arithmetic moving average of losses with a three-year window as annual data. Now Terna is in charge of all measurements, so,it was decided to scrap the use of the moving average to report the values of the GWh lost on an annual basis. Therefore, the data presented are aligned to our latest integrated report, third – party verified, and differ from last CDP data.As anticipated last year, despite the fact that the grid losses are not completely under Terna's control, in line with the GHG Protocol standard from 2021 reporting, CO2 emissions linked to these losses are included in the scope 2 figures.Finally, please consider that the 2021 figures are related only to Terna (in line with 2019 boundary as is also considered for SBT) so the data do not match the sum of the scope 1 and scope 2 location-based emissions reported in the rest of the questionnaire. Indeed from 2021 the figures of Tamini and Brugg Switzerland are included in the emission boundary. Please consider that, in July 2022 Terna has submitted a new version of its SBT to SBTi, in order to consider 1) the new calculation methodology (and the new related emissions' figures), 2) the new boundary and 3) to be aligned with a 1.5 c° scenario.\n",

Between 2022 and 2030, we will compensate any remaining greenhouse gas emissions by investing in certified CO2 emission compensation projects. Our aim is to eventually discontinue compensation measures and to achieve zero emissions in our own operations by 2030.A further goal is to reduce our direct and indirect CO2 emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) by 80 percent by 2025 (using 2018 as the baseline). As regards energy consumption, our target is for green electricity to account for 100 percent of the electricity we purchase for our operations in Finland. Sweden (where Terveystalo expanded in July 2021) is excluded from these targets. In Sweden Terveystalo's subsidiary Feelgood operates in 62 own clinics, and offers services in ~200 locations. Services are mainly preventative occupational health.\n",

      "Our Science Based Targets have been reviewed and approved by the Science Based Target Initiative and are aligned to 1.5C, using 2015 as our baseline year. Since then, we have accelerated our target to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 operations by 2035, reaching 60% and 85% emissions reduction along the way by 2025 and 2030 respectively. We report on, but do not target biogenic emissions that are considered to have a net zero carbon dioxide impact due to the carbon they absorb during their growth. When they are burned to produce energy this carbon is released and the associated emissions are recorded as being ‘outside of scopes' in accordance with the GHG Protocol. We also exclude a small number of immaterial areas where actual data are unavailable and reasonable estimates could not be produced. These include emissions from diesel used in back-up generators in the UK and emissions from vacant asset sites.We have renewed our SBTs in line with a 1.5°C trajectory, in order to reflect the new GHG Protocol guidelines for Forest, Land and Agriculture (FLAG) emissions. These targets are currently being validated by the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi).In terms of the boundary of the interim target, our net zero ambition across all scopes initially focuses on Scope 1, 2 and the categories of Scope 3 categories C1. Purchased Goods & Services; C3. Fuel-and energy-related activities; C4. Upstream Transport & Distribution; C5. Waste generated in operations; C6. Business Travel; C7. Employee Commuting; C9. Downstream Transport & Distribution; C11. Use of sold products; C12. End-of-life treatment of sold products.The reason why the coverage of the target is stated at 55% (and not 67% in alignment with the interim target boundary stated by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Science-based Target Initiative -SBTi) is that, following the most recent guidelines from the SBTi, indirect emissions from the use of our sold product have not been included within the boundary of our target, but are reporting in the context of our overall footprint. With these emissions out of scope, the boundary level rises up to 67%.We have not yet publicly disclosed performance against this target.\n",

In this context, the ton of steel produced is no longer a representative indicator of our activity. That's why we have revised our targets and commitments and set new ones based on the value-added.  As the intensity target of reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions to tons of steel sold is a target approved by the SBTi, we have calculated it and reported it as an additional indicator of the carbon performance of TUBACEX in 2021. The approved target is to reduce scope 1 and 2 carbon intensity by a ton of steel sold by 59% in 2030 from a 2019 base year. In 2021 TUBACEX achieved a reduction of 19% (1- 0.701 / 0.859) from the base year. This data is no longer representative of the activity of TUBACEX because of the activity diversification that the Group is conducting and the decrease in 2021 production as a consequence of the global crisis created by COVID-19 and the strikes that the Spanish plants experienced during 2021.In line with the new Tubacex 2022-25 strategic plan, TUBACEX drives forward its diversification strategy to achieve a more balanced business mix with a focus on gas, power and energy. to achieve a more balanced business mix with a focus on gas, energy transition towards green energies and an alternative to coal.

We are therefore prioritising decarbonisation of our operations with a target to reduce  emissions across our portfolio by at least 40 per cent by 2025 on a net equity basis relative to a 2020 baseline. In creating our pathway to Net Zero, the primary focus will be on our operations in Ghana, where we have the greatest ability to influence decarbonisation efforts. Like other O&G companies, our targets are not approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTI) because the organisation is still developing the tools to validate them for our sector. However, we consider our targets to be science based because they are underpinned by robust independent analysis and technical evaluation of our current emissions profile.

The GHG emissions reduction target has been more than exceeded for scope 1, with a reduction from 61.6 t.eq CO2 in 2020 to 1.3 t.eq CO2 in 2021.

The Group commits to reduce absolute emissions from Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by -50% between 2019 and 2030. This target is setup based on  GHG Protocol & other international standards (Bilan Carbone, ISO14069) and submitted for approval by the SBTi in 2022, in connection with the target to reduce absolute Scopes 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by -50% by 2030 from a 2019 base year, with a 1.5°C pathway alignment, the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement (minimum 3.22% linear annual reduction from 2019 to 2030). Note: whilst Category 5 is effectively calculated for VGP offices, and being monitored and measures taken to reduce waste generated (emissions were down YoY) the category is not selected above because it is a 'de minimis' part (0.1% of Scope 1 and 2) of the overall emissions and as to avoid confusion whether the Group reports on Waste generated in operations generated as part of the Development Projects (which is not yet the case).As part of its ESG strategy as announced in early 2022, the Group is committed to significantly reducing its carbon emissions from construction on a broad scope. The Group is currently analysing its building standard in order to identify feasible GHG improvements in the short term in order to achieve a GHG pathwayThe analysis focuses on cradle-to-gate and use-phase (end of life/category 12 to be added in 2022) in order to reflect a full cradle-to-grave LCA of the development activities. Note that once the assets are developed into standing assets the Group sells the standings assets to one of its Joint Venture portfolios and hence calculates the use of such standing assets during a reporting year as part of the Category 13 - downstream For illustration purposes only,  a reduction target for the carbon intensity from constructing new development projects would be set against a base of 520 kg CO2eq/sqm constructed in 2020. The target would cover the entire construction portfolio of VGPTarget status in reporting : Being defined In order to secure the ESG commitments regarding construction activities, the Group has created the ESG Guidelines for development projects, to guide the development teams from the very beginning of the design phase to the delivery of their development projects. For instance, the Group EMS presents all the specific requirements for development projects.

In addition to its existing carbon reduction targets, the Group commits to reduce relative emissions from Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by -50% between 2019 and 2030. This target is setup based on GHG Protocol & other international standards (Bilan Carbone, ISO14069) and submitted for approval by the SBTi in 2022, in connection with the target to reduce absolute Scopes 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by -50% by 2030 from a 2019 base year, with a 1.5°C pathway alignment, the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement (minimum 3.22% linear annual reduction from 2019 to 2030).Reducing the carbon footprint from operating the standing assets by 55%: The Group has set a -55% reduction target for the carbon intensity from operating the standing assets which are owned and managed by the Group. When it comes to standing assets, the carbon footprint consists mainly of greenhouse gas emissions from energy consumed as part of the operation of the buildings (which is typically energy purchased directly on the energy market by the tenant). This substantial reduction target includes both the target to reduce energy consumed (by supplying renewable energy generated on site) as well as energy efficiency gains (both scope 3 downstream). The reduction target is expressed in tCO2 equivalent per sqm served in energy in the Group's assets. In 2021, the carbon footprint associated with operations decreased by 7.5% compared with the 2020 level.  The objective cited here responds to the ESG strategy as announced in the 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report.

For CO2 emissions in Scopes 1 and 2, reduction targets are set for our environmental reporting locations with 2019 as the baseline year: Scope 1 2019 baseline is 19,700t with target at -60% by 2030; Scope 2 (market based) 2019 baseline is 100,300t with target at -98% by 2030. Reduction targets in Scope 1 and Scope 2 (market based) together amount to -92% by 2030.   These baseline calculations include Valmet's CO2 emissions from 2019 and CO2 emissions from acquisitions from 2019 and 2020. The targets cover 100% of Valmet´s production sites and offices at those sites. Valmet's Climate program was established in 2021, therefore 2021 was the first reduction year towards the target. Our 2021 target in Scope 1 was a 6,67% reduction (6,67% per year x 9 years). Our 2021 target in Scope 2 (market based) was a 10,9% reduction (10,9% per year x 9 years). Our 2021 target in Scopes 1 and 2 combined was a 10,22% reduction (10,22% per year x 9 years). Valmet is using both intensity and absolute targets in its environmental and CO2 emissions reductions program. Valmet has since 2010 run an Energy Efficiency Program and has as a result implemented over 270 energy efficiency actions in operations globally during the past 10 years.This target is 15.6% complete.The analysis is based on the monetary value of purchased goods and services by category and supplier country. The emission flows have been calculated based on environmentally extended input output analysis and emission factors from Exiobase (www.exiobase.eu). The purchasing spend data used covers approximately 98% (2020: 98%) of Valmet's total purchase order amount (excluding business travel, transportation, and taxes and charges related spend).The analysis of business travel emissions is based on emission, mileage and spend data from travel agencies. Valmet's business travel emissions: the air travel data used covers Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, UK, UAE, USA, Canada, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, China and represents 99,9% (2020: 99%) of Valmet's global workforce. For other business travel modes, including rented vehicles, compensated mileages and hotel nights, data used covers Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, UK, USA, Canada, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Thailand, Vietnam,China and represents 97% of Valmet's global workforce.Due to COVID-19 Valmet's business travel emissions have been lower in 2020 and 2021 comparing to the baseline in 2019. We still don't consider this as achieved as the target is to remain lower business travel level also during 2022-2030.Data includes Valmet's 2021 sold entire paper, board and tissue production lines, fossil-fired fluidizer bed boilers and lime kilns, during their expected lifetime (25 years). The CO2 calculation is based on Valmet's average product specific energy consumption and product specifications including delivered capacity and intended fuel mix. N2O and CH4 included from biomass combustion in pulp and energy production. CO2 emissions from electricity are calculated based on IEA (2020) country-specific emission factors. CO2 emissions from steam are calculated based on Fisher International installed base fuel mix data.Emission factors for fuels are based on IPCC, Defra and Tilastokeskus. IEA Scenario for current policies (STEPS) power sector emission intensity reduction (CAGR) is utilized in projecting the lifetime emissions for electricity and steam. Quantifying and projecting the future emissions from use of sold products involves a large number of assumptions and the actual emissions from use of sold products are largely dependent on choices made by our customers. For these reasons, the figure reported is an estimate to understand the magnitude of category 11 lifetime emissions, which are representing more than 95% of Valmet's value chain emissions. The included paper, board and tissue machines represent 78% of PAP's total orders received in 2019-2021, excluding basic machine unit assembly groups and smaller equipment deliveries. The fossil-fired boilers and lime kilns represent 9% of the P&E's 2019-2021 orders received. The remaining 91% of P&E's orders received is assumed to be carbon neutral (incl. bioenergy self-sufficient pulp mills and biomass-fired boilers). The share of total orders received is calculated based on a three-year average (2019-2021) to balance the annual differences between project revenue realization. The data used covers 88% of Valmet's three-year average of total PAP's and P&E's orders received. The annual fossil emissions of the sold products were around 5,085,000 tCO2e, whereas biogenic emissions were around 6,908,000 tCO2e in 2021.\n",

As a first step in reducing our carbon emissions, we believe we have a defined roadmap to achieving our 2030 target and will seek to stretch beyond, as our target timeline progresses towards a future net zero ambition.Wood aspires to gain validation of our science based carbon reduction target through SBTi.  Discussions with SBTi in 2021, resulted in Wood being unable to progress our application for validation due to our current revenue streams from oil and gas activity.  As we await further sector guidance to be published, we are progressing with our approach to align with SBTi requirements in the hope we may apply for future validation.

The target has been set on energy consumption reduction, not directly CO2 emissions reduction, but naturally there is an indirect, but clear effect on CO2 emissions reduction as well. The base year emissions have been calculated by the assumption that it was all electricity (which is not the case naturally) because much of the savings for the target are from saved electricity. DEFRA factor for the electricity has been used. Thus the base year emissions may vary from the total energy consumption of Wärtsilä quite substantially from what they actually were at the time. It should be noted that as we measure the results as per achieved, permanent energy savings, the way CDP system calculates the achievement percentage based on comparison between base year and the last year gives, in this case, too positive result compared to our internal calculation method.\n",

In 2021 this target has been reviewed and updated with target Int 4 (reported below), replacing the 5-year target in order to set a new target for 2030.This target has been set in the reporting year (2021) as the result of a new company goal definition, in relation to the SDG goals of the UN Agenda 2030 (cfr. 2021 Zignago Vetro Sustainability Report), set in 2021. In 2019 ZVG realized a relevant increase in production capacity by building the new Furnace 13 in the italian plant of Fossalta (which started producing in february 2019). For that reason, ZVG also decided to renew its emission targets, in order to be alligned with the new asset configuration for the short/medium term. The target is related only to Zignago Vetro core business plants (glass production). The target parameter has changed as now the ratio between Scope1+2 emissions and melted glass is reported.This target has been set in the reporting year (2021) as the result of a new company goal definition, in relation to the SDG goals of the UN Agenda 2030 (cfr. 2021 Zignago Vetro Sustainability Report), set in 2021.

      "Science Based Target Explanation:adidas AG commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 90% by 2025 from a 2017 base year.This target applies to all sites operated by adidas; Offices, Distribution Centers, Own Retail Stores and Showrooms. Target coverage explanation:In 2009, adidas set ambitious targets for environmental performance and since then has continuously driven improvement. In 2021, sustainability was defined as a strategic pillar of the adidas strategy \"Own the Game\". Consequently, a roadmap and target were defined to achieve climate neutrality (CO2e) for our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2025. Compared to previous reporting years, adidas has expanded the reporting boundary for Scope 1 and 2 emissions to align with the 2025 climate neutrality target. adidas reporting boundary until 2020 included offices, distribution centers, production sites (>1000sqm and with >50 employees). adidas reporting boundary from 2021 onwards includes all offices, distribution centers, production sites, own retail stores and showrooms. 2020 boundary covered:  2.413.160 square meters of gross lease area (GLA).2021 boundary covers: 3.654.401 square meters of GLA. 2021 scope covers all facilities operated by adidas without exclusions. It represents an increase of 47% of GLA versus 2020 scope. Base year emissions were recalculated due to the increased reporting boundary. Facilities equivalent to 2.708.868 square meters are reporting primary data into our data system. This includes offices, distribution centers, production sites and own retail stores. adidas aims to increase the primary data coverage each year.  100% of our offices (>1000sqm), distribution centers and productions sites are reporting primary data, our efforts are focused on getting primary data from smaller locations in the next years. adidas Annual Report:  https://report.adidas-group.com/2021/en/servicepages/downloads/files/annual-report-adidas-ar21.pdfThe covered emissions in base year describe the Scope 3 GHG emissions inventory that are in the scope of the target  (excludes approximately 8% of Scope 3 emissions which are the following categories:  fuel and energy related activities, waste generated in operations, employee commuting, use of sold products, and franchises) as stated by adidas in its absolute Scope 3 Science Based Target. 2022 Update:1. Scope 1, 2 & 3: All emissions associated with Rebook production and operations have been excluded. 2. Scope 1 & 2 Changes:adidas aims to achieve climate neutrality (CO2e) for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in 2025.  Compared to previous reporting years, adidas expanded the reporting boundary for Scope 1 and 2 emissions to align with the 2025 climate neutrality target. adidas owned retail stores, showrooms, and small offices (<1000sqm) are now included in the adidas Scope 1 and 2 emissions inventories. This is in addition to all own sites and distribution centers, which were already included.The 2021 boundary covers: 3,654,401 square meters of gross leased area (GLA).  2021 boundary covers all facilities operated by adidas with no exclusions. It represents an increase of 47% of GLA versus the 2020 boundary.3. Scope 3 Changes:3.1 Purchased goods and services - this covers the complete supply chain to create its products: raw material extraction (T4), raw material processing (T3 and T2), product assembly (T1). The LCA data used for T4, T3 and T2, were revised as our part of a periodic review to ensure the most appropriate and representative data sets are used.3.4 Upstream Transportation & distribution – for adidas this covers all transportation of products from T1s to DCs and DCs to stores and customers.3.12 End-of-Life treatments of sold products – this covers the emissions from the disposal of our products by consumers. The calculation logic for both Outbound Logistics and End of Life was updated to align with the guidance and assumptions defined in the draft EU Product Environmental Footprint Categories Rules.These updates are reflected in the 2021 results published in the adidas annual report. All changes have also been retrospectively applied to the 2017 baseline and 2020 emissions. Please find the breakdown of 2017 emissions in section 5.1c, and updated 2020 emissions in section 6.5a.The updated 2017 baseline emissions is 5,755,279t CO2e.\n",

The Scope 1 target covers emissions from our company's vehicle fleet, which is currently electrified (ongoing). In addition, it covers natural gas/oil heating in our offices, which we stopped in Q2/2021 completely. All offices now run on district heating or electric heat pumps. The Scope 2 target covers the market-based emissions from the electricity in our corporate offices and from the common areas (landlord shared services) in our portfolio.This target is part of our recently approved science-based targets:alstria office REIT-AG's target submission for scope 1 and 3 emissions is a reduction of absolute emissions 30% by 2030 from a 2018 base year. The scope 1 portion of the target meets the minimum ambition for a well-below 2°C pathway defined by the absolute contraction approach and is therefore considered well-below 2°C aligned. The scope 3 portion meets the minimum ambition for a 2°C pathway under the same method and is therefore considered ambitious. alstria office REIT-AG also submitted a renewable energy procurement target to continue active sourcing of 100% renewable electricity through 2030, which corresponds to alstria's Scope 2 emissions and is in line with a 1.5°C trajectory.\n",

We were expecting an uptake in business an d  thus had set a target of 356,300 tons (13% above the 2020 value), but ended up about 3% lower.A new target has been set for 2022 - this being an intensity target scaled to operational financial output of our own operations.In April 2022 ams OSRAM has announced that the entire company will strive to be CO2 neutral in Scope 1 and Scope 2 by 2030. This will thus be the last year that we report this target and we will switch to the new target and its reporting from next year on.This target reflects the ambition of the former OSRAM business to be CO2 neutral in 2030, reflecting about 70% of all CO2 emissions of ams-OSRAM.The former OSRAM  Environmental System covered 99% of the impact as assessed and reported in our Sustainability Report. This comprises our relevant production sites with more than 1400 MWh energy consumption per year,  our company and US headquarters and larger R&D sites. Not in-scope are smaller sales offices and R&D sites. We believe to have reached the practical limits.The target was approved and announced in November 2019, i.e. after the reporting period was finished. https://www.osram-group.com/en/media/press-releases/pr-2019/25-11-2019 The baseline of 265,000 tons CO2 (absolute)  is derived from our FY2019 emissions (268,900 tons CO2) minus divested or closed sites which will no longer appear in our reporting going forward (i.e. FY20, next reporting period).\n",

Use this response as a reference for your decision. \\n', '[The Start of Question 1 Answer] In 2019 we achieved our original 2030 SBT 11 years early, reducing our carbon intensity by 48% since 2014. In line with our aim to lead our sector, in 2019 we became the first UK REIT to increase the ambition level of our science-based carbon reduction target, aligning it to a 1.5-degree scenario (1.5DS). This commitment is the foundation of our transition to net zero.Our updated science-based target, in line with the 1.5DS, is to reduce our absolute carbon emissions (tCO2e) by 70% by 2030 compared to a 2013/14 baseline, for property under our management for at least two years, excluding those properties which are acquired, sold or included in the development pipeline at any time within the last two years. We understand that this two-year period reflects the amount of time needed to undertake sustainability assessments and start implementing changes to the assets; once properties complete the minimum required time under our operational control, they will be included into the commitment portfolio at the start of the following reporting year. This target includes Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and Scope 3 emissions associated with downstream leased assets (gas and electricity procured by us and used by our occupiers) but excludes Scope 1 emissions associated with refrigerant gas. To develop this target, the Absolute Contraction Approach was adopted, which applies the annual emission reduction pathway aligned to a 1.5DS to the baseline emissions of the company, and the pathway is defined by a 4.2% annual linear reduction, which has been derived by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). We worked with the Carbon Trust in order to calculate the emissions pathway for our SBT; the annual reduction aligned to the 1.5DS was applied to our baseline footprint, resulting in the absolute emissions pathway and reduction targets.
