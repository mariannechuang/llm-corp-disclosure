    "Title: Greenwashing Responses with 3 Different Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview:\n",
    "This script takes in original climate disclosure responses and greenwashes them using the prompts below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Main Features:\n",
    "- Rewrites company responses to two key CDP questions:\n",
    "    Absolute Emissions Targets (C4.1a)\n",
    "    Emissions Intensity Targets (C4.1b)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supports three prompt strictness levels:\n",
    "    Loose: Ignores length/accuracy constraints.\n",
    "    Medium: Enforces accuracy (factual intent) but not length\n",
    "    Strict: Preserves accuracy and length (original word count)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How to Run:\n",
    "1. Install dependencies:\n",
    "    openai\n",
    "    pandas\n",
    "    numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Set up your OpenAI API key in `api_keys.py`.\n",
    "    ex. # api_keys.py\n",
    "        OPEN_AI_API_KEYS = [\"your-api-key-here\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Adjust the input and output file paths as needed in the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:\n",
    "Make sure the company responses are aligned with the model's input requirements."
