APERAM,Luxembourg,Iron & steel,"Metal smelting, refining & forming",Materials,,"Our target covers 100% of our industrial plants, offices and sales offices.Our objective is based on improvement of our raw material and energy efficiency improvement in all of our plants. As a matter of fact, Aperam's carbon footprint is substantially lower than the worldwide sector average. This is due to our extensive usage of charcoal in replacement of extractive coke in Brazil, on the one hand, and the use of recycled stainless steel scrap input material in our Electric Arc Furnace, on the other hand.The CO2 emissions due to the energy consumption (mainly electricity and natural gas) represent 82% of our scope 1+2 CO2e emissions, the rest is mainly due to the ferro-alloys.Aperam's  target ''-30% by 2030” covers 100% of scope 1+2 CO2e emissions of the company. This includes all our main production facilities and also our steel service centers.In 2019, we announced that Aperam will be ""Neutral Carbon"" by 2050 for its European operations. In 2021, we are proud of the state-of-the-art CO2 footprint and of our action plan to reduce it further and become carbon neutral globally by 2050.We changed from ""Scope 2 location based"" to ""Scope 2 market based"" to take into account our actions with energy suppliers, especially regarding renewable energy sources.The value ''0.35 tCO2e/tslab” as a result of 2021 is calculated based on the 2021 methodology. We give this result to be compliant with the answer written in the 2021 CDP questionnaire. In 2022, we define a new target with a change in the methodology calculation that we explain in the Int 3 target reference number.Our target covers 100% of our industrial plants, offices and sales offices.Our objective is based on improvement of our raw material and energy efficiency improvement in all of our plants. As a matter of fact, Aperam's carbon footprint is substantially lower than the worldwide sector average. This is due to our extensive usage of charcoal in replacement of extractive coke in Brazil, on the one hand, and the use of recycled stainless steel scrap input material in our Electric Arc Furnace, on the other hand.The CO2 emissions due to the energy consumption (mainly electricity and natural gas) represent 70% of our scope 1+2 CO2e emissions, the rest is mainly due to the ferro-alloys and the charcoal production.Aperam's  target ''0.30 tCO2e/t crude steel by 2030” cover 100% of scope 1+2 CO2e emissions of the company. This includes all our main production facilities and also our steel service centers.In 2021, we are proud of the state-of-the-art CO2 footprint and of our action plan to reduce it further and become carbon neutral globally by 2050.Our forest is continuously cultivated and maintained according to the best practices, from the careful genetic selection of the sapling to the planting, the maintenance, down to the harvesting. After the harvest, BioEnergia is then sending the trees to kilns where they are turned to charcoal (biomass). This forest is factually carbon positive, meaning it acts as a carbon sink. Indeed, our parcels stock CO2 in the cultivated areas, in the trees and with the soil where leaves degrade into humus. In the past, we were not assessing this impact, relying on the simple methodology to consider the full life cycle effect of the charcoal as nil, as the CO2 stocked in the trunk was supposed to be released later at our steel plant. But in 2020-21, we decided to follow the best practices emerging in Brazil and conduct a specific and thorough CO2e impact analysis, with the help of experts. They confirmed our assumption and the powerful CO2e capture operated by the forestry. We double checked the evaluation, thanks to an external audit, which was done locally by the SGS firm, based on ISO 14064 standard.This new methodology highlights massive carbon captures, now consolidated in Scope 1+2 net in absolute value to bring a complete view of our footprint."
Grupo Cooperativo Cajamar,Spain,Banks,Financial services,Services,"Since July 2015, all electricity consumed by the Group comes from renewable sources (so it applies to the whole Group). This target is linked to the purchase of renewable electricity with a certified guarantee of origin. In 2021, 87,574GJ of electricity were consumed. In 2021, indirect CO₂ emissions from the electricity consumed were zero.  In 2021, the various actions carried out resulted in energy savings of more than 404.20 GJ. In addition, the Group is implementing an ISO 50001-compliant EMS to continue adapting its facilities and equipment to future regulatory changes and optimize resources to improve its energy performance.Also noteworthy is the 2021-2023 Eco-efficiency Plan (as a continuation of the previous Eco-efficiency Plan), which is systematically implemented and updated in order to improve the Group's competitiveness by reducing costs and minimizing the negative impact of its activities on the environment. This plan is accompanied by various key indicators that measure the Group's environmental performance. One of them is to continue contracting 100% renewable energy.It should be noted that although the target has been achieved, the objective is to continue to consume 100% renewable energy as set out in the Group's Eco-efficiency Plan. So the objective is maintenance.The Group has set a company-wide target of Scope 1 plus Scope 2.   It should be noted that in Scope 1, the Group calculates the emissions of  the Vehicle  fleet plus the coolants. In the case of Scope 2, the Group calculates emissions of the electricity consumption. In both cases (Scope 1 + Scope 2) the target covers 100% of emissions. In particular, the Group commits to reduce its absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 46.2% by 2030 from a 2019 base year and commits to continue annually sourcing 100% renewable electricity through 2030. Note that the absolute emission reduction approach is based on science. Specifically, the linear annual reduction is set at 4.20% to contribute to limiting warming to below 1.5°C (the most ambitious target) when compared to the minimum reduction required for targets in line with the well below 2°C scenarios, which is 2.5°C.It should be noted that the targets set in 2021 (Abs 6, Abs 7 and Abs 8) have been retired since in 2021 the Group has reviewed all the targets so that they can be validated by the SBTis in order to be able to present them during the year. In the case of (Abs 9) it has been retired as a result of the Group's portfolio target setting (detailed in question C-FS4.1d).","The Group has set a company-wide target of Scope 1 plus Scope 2. It should be noted that for Scope 1, the Group calculates emissions from the vehicle fleet plus refrigerants. For Scope 2, the Group calculates emissions from electricity consumption. In both cases (Scope 1 + Scope 2) the target covers 100% of emissions. The objective is to reduce Scope 1 + 2 emissions by 31% per employee from 2019 to the target year considering a constant workforce. ""Revised"" has been indicated as in 2021 the Group has revised all targets so that they can be validated by the SBTis and thus submitted during the year."

Marks and Spencer Group plc,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Supermarkets, food & drugstores",Convenience retail,Retail,"Target covers scope 1, 2 and 3.  Use of sold products is excluded - Excluded as optional under GHG Protocol and data is very difficult to measure accurately. Note - this target will supersede Abs 2 and Abs 3In 2021/22 we undertook a detailed review of our Scope 3 emissions inventory to inform the Baseline for our updated SBT, and Net Zero Roadmap. The Scope 3 baseline data in this year's CDP submission (c4.1a and c5.2) reflects this updated inventory.The target covers all scope 1 & 2 global operational emissionsThis (Abs 3) is a follow-on target to Abs 2.",
Robert Bosch GmbH,Germany,Fabricated metal components,Metal products manufacturing,Manufacturing,"This target refers to the energy we generate ourselves and the volume we purchase for manufacturing, R&D and administration (scopes 1 and 2 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, GHG). This is where we can directly influence the reduction of greenhouse gases and make a big impact in a short time. The target applies to all 430 sites within our consolidation.We analyzed all scope 3 categories in accordance with the GHG Protocol using external databases and then focused on those from which the majority (99 percent) of CO2 emissions originate. According to the findings, upstream emissions in the Bosch value chain primarily concern purchased goods and services, capital goods as well as upstream transport andlogistics. Downstream emissions are mainly caused by the use of our products and downstream transport and logistics.",
